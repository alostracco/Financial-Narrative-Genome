    "                One thing we’ve learned from the COVID-19 crisis is how important Amazon has become to our customers. We\n",
    "want you to know we take this responsibility seriously, and we’re proud of the work our teams are doing to help\n",
    "customers through this difficult time.\n",
    "Amazonians are working around the clock to get necessary supplies delivered directly to the doorsteps of people\n",
    "who need them. The demand we are seeing for essential products has been and remains high. But unlike a\n",
    "predictable holiday surge, this spike occurred with little warning, creating major challenges for our suppliers and\n",
    "delivery network. We quickly prioritized the stocking and delivery of essential household staples, medical\n",
    "supplies, and other critical products.\n",
    "Our Whole Foods Market stores have remained open, providing fresh food and other vital goods for customers.\n",
    "We are taking steps to help those most vulnerable to the virus, setting aside the first hour of shopping at Whole\n",
    "Foods each day for seniors. We have temporarily closed Amazon Books, Amazon 4-star, and Amazon Pop Up\n",
    "stores because they don’t sell essential products, and we offered associates from those closed stores the\n",
    "opportunity to continue working in other parts of Amazon.\n",
    "Crucially, while providing these essential services, we are focused on the safety of our employees and contractors\n",
    "around the world—we are deeply grateful for their heroic work and are committed to their health and well-being.\n",
    "Consulting closely with medical experts and health authorities, we’ve made over 150 significant process changes\n",
    "in our operations network and Whole Foods Market stores to help teams stay healthy, and we conduct daily\n",
    "audits of the measures we’ve put into place. We’ve distributed face masks and implemented temperature checks\n",
    "at sites around the world to help protect employees and support staff. We regularly sanitize door handles,\n",
    "stairway handrails, lockers, elevator buttons, and touch screens, and disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer are\n",
    "standard across our network.\n",
    "We’ve also introduced extensive social distancing measures to help protect our associates. We have eliminated\n",
    "stand-up meetings during shifts, moved information sharing to bulletin boards, staggered break times, and spread\n",
    "out chairs in breakrooms. While training new hires is challenging with new distancing requirements, we continue\n",
    "to ensure that every new employee gets six hours of safety training. We’ve shifted training protocols so we don’t\n",
    "have employees gathering in one spot, and we’ve adjusted our hiring processes to allow for social distancing.\n",
    "A next step in protecting our employees might be regular testing of all Amazonians, including those showing no\n",
    "symptoms. Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get\n",
    "the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than\n",
    "is currently available. If every person could be tested regularly, it would make a huge difference in how we fight\n",
    "this virus. Those who test positive could be quarantined and cared for, and everyone who tests negative could\n",
    "re-enter the economy with confidence.\n",
    "We’ve begun the work of building incremental testing capacity. A team of Amazonians—from research scientists\n",
    "and program managers to procurement specialists and software engineers—moved from their normal day jobs\n",
    "onto a dedicated team to work on this initiative. We have begun assembling the equipment we need to build our\n",
    "first lab and hope to start testing small numbers of our frontline employees soon. We are not sure how far we will\n",
    "get in the relevant timeframe, but we think it’s worth trying, and we stand ready to share anything we learn.\n",
    "While we explore longer-term solutions, we are also committed to helping support employees now. We increased\n",
    "our minimum wage through the end of April by $2 per hour in the U.S., $2 per hour in Canada, £2 per hour in the\n",
    "UK, and €2 per hour in many European countries. And we are paying associates double our regular rate for any\n",
    "overtime worked—a minimum of $34 an hour—an increase from time and a half. These wage increases will cost\n",
    "more than $500 million, just through the end of April, and likely more than that over time. While we recognize\n",
    "this is expensive, we believe it’s the right thing to do under the circumstances. We also established the Amazon\n",
    "Relief Fund—with an initial $25 million in funding—to support our independent delivery service partners and\n",
    "their drivers, Amazon Flex participants, and temporary employees under financial distress.\n",
    "In March, we opened 100,000 new positions across our fulfillment and delivery network. Earlier this week, after\n",
    "successfully filling those roles, we announced we were creating another 75,000 jobs to respond to customer\n",
    "demand. These new hires are helping customers who depend on us to meet their critical needs. We know that\n",
    "many people around the world have suffered financially as jobs are lost or furloughed. We are happy to have\n",
    "them on our teams until things return to normal and either their former employer can bring them back or new\n",
    "jobs become available. We’ve welcomed Joe Duffy, who joined after losing his job as a mechanic at Newark\n",
    "airport and learned about an opening from a friend who is an Amazon operations analyst. Dallas preschool\n",
    "teacher Darby Griffin joined after her school closed on March 9th and now helps manage new inventory. We’re\n",
    "happy to have Darby with us until she can return to the classroom.\n",
    "Amazon is acting aggressively to protect our customers from bad actors looking to exploit the crisis. We’ve\n",
    "removed over half a million offers from our stores due to COVID-based price gouging, and we’ve suspended\n",
    "more than 6,000 selling accounts globally for violating our fair-pricing policies. Amazon turned over information\n",
    "about sellers we suspect engaged in price gouging of products related to COVID-19 to 42 state attorneys general\n",
    "offices. To accelerate our response to price-gouging incidents, we created a special communication channel for\n",
    "state attorneys general to quickly and easily escalate consumer complaints to us.\n",
    "Amazon Web Services is also playing an important role in this crisis. The ability for organizations to access\n",
    "scalable, dependable, and highly secure computing power—whether for vital healthcare work, to help students\n",
    "continue learning, or to keep unprecedented numbers of employees online and productive from home—is critical\n",
    "in this situation. Hospital networks, pharmaceutical companies, and research labs are using AWS to care for\n",
    "patients, explore treatments, and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 in many other ways. Academic institutions\n",
    "around the world are transitioning from in-person to virtual classrooms and are running on AWS to help ensure\n",
    "continuity of learning. And governments are leveraging AWS as a secure platform to build out new capabilities\n",
    "in their efforts to end this pandemic.\n",
    "We are collaborating with the World Health Organization, supplying advanced cloud technologies and technical\n",
    "expertise to track the virus, understand the outbreak, and better contain its spread. WHO is leveraging our cloud\n",
    "to build large-scale data lakes, aggregate epidemiological country data, rapidly translate medical training videos\n",
    "into different languages, and help global healthcare workers better treat patients. We are separately making a\n",
    "public AWS COVID-19 data lake available as a centralized repository for up-to-date and curated information\n",
    "related to the spread and characteristics of the virus and its associated illness so experts can access and analyze\n",
    "the latest data in their battle against the disease.\n",
    "We also launched the AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative, a program to support customers working to bring\n",
    "more accurate diagnostic solutions to market for COVID-19. Better diagnostics help accelerate treatment and\n",
    "containment of this pandemic. We committed $20 million to accelerate this work and help our customers harness\n",
    "the cloud to tackle this challenge. While the program was established in response to COVID-19, we also are\n",
    "looking toward the future, and we will fund diagnostic research projects that have the potential to blunt future\n",
    "infectious disease outbreaks.\n",
