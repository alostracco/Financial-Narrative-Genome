    "# want you to know we take this responsibility seriously, and we’re proud of the work our teams are doing to help\n",
    "# customers through this difficult time.\n",
    "# Amazonians are working around the clock to get necessary supplies delivered directly to the doorsteps of people\n",
    "# who need them. The demand we are seeing for essential products has been and remains high. But unlike a\n",
    "# predictable holiday surge, this spike occurred with little warning, creating major challenges for our suppliers and\n",
    "# delivery network. We quickly prioritized the stocking and delivery of essential household staples, medical\n",
    "# supplies, and other critical products.\n",
    "# Our Whole Foods Market stores have remained open, providing fresh food and other vital goods for customers.\n",
    "# We are taking steps to help those most vulnerable to the virus, setting aside the first hour of shopping at Whole\n",
    "# Foods each day for seniors. We have temporarily closed Amazon Books, Amazon 4-star, and Amazon Pop Up\n",
    "# stores because they don’t sell essential products, and we offered associates from those closed stores the\n",
    "# opportunity to continue working in other parts of Amazon.\n",
    "# Crucially, while providing these essential services, we are focused on the safety of our employees and contractors\n",
    "# around the world—we are deeply grateful for their heroic work and are committed to their health and well-being.\n",
    "# Consulting closely with medical experts and health authorities, we’ve made over 150 significant process changes\n",
    "# in our operations network and Whole Foods Market stores to help teams stay healthy, and we conduct daily\n",
    "# audits of the measures we’ve put into place. We’ve distributed face masks and implemented temperature checks\n",
    "# at sites around the world to help protect employees and support staff. We regularly sanitize door handles,\n",
    "# stairway handrails, lockers, elevator buttons, and touch screens, and disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer are\n",
    "# standard across our network.\n",
    "# We’ve also introduced extensive social distancing measures to help protect our associates. We have eliminated\n",
    "# stand-up meetings during shifts, moved information sharing to bulletin boards, staggered break times, and spread\n",
    "# out chairs in breakrooms. While training new hires is challenging with new distancing requirements, we continue\n",
    "# to ensure that every new employee gets six hours of safety training. We’ve shifted training protocols so we don’t\n",
    "# have employees gathering in one spot, and we’ve adjusted our hiring processes to allow for social distancing.\n",
    "# A next step in protecting our employees might be regular testing of all Amazonians, including those showing no\n",
    "# symptoms. Regular testing on a global scale, across all industries, would both help keep people safe and help get\n",
    "# the economy back up and running. For this to work, we as a society would need vastly more testing capacity than\n",
    "# is currently available. If every person could be tested regularly, it would make a huge difference in how we fight\n",
    "# this virus. Those who test positive could be quarantined and cared for, and everyone who tests negative could\n",
    "# re-enter the economy with confidence.\n",
    "# We’ve begun the work of building incremental testing capacity. A team of Amazonians—from research scientists\n",
    "# and program managers to procurement specialists and software engineers—moved from their normal day jobs\n",
    "# onto a dedicated team to work on this initiative. We have begun assembling the equipment we need to build our\n",
    "# first lab and hope to start testing small numbers of our frontline employees soon. We are not sure how far we will\n",
    "# get in the relevant timeframe, but we think it’s worth trying, and we stand ready to share anything we learn.\n",
    "# While we explore longer-term solutions, we are also committed to helping support employees now. We increased\n",
    "# our minimum wage through the end of April by $2 per hour in the U.S., $2 per hour in Canada, £2 per hour in the\n",
    "# UK, and €2 per hour in many European countries. And we are paying associates double our regular rate for any\n",
    "# overtime worked—a minimum of $34 an hour—an increase from time and a half. These wage increases will cost\n",
    "# more than $500 million, just through the end of April, and likely more than that over time. While we recognize\n",
    "# this is expensive, we believe it’s the right thing to do under the circumstances. We also established the Amazon\n",
    "# Relief Fund—with an initial $25 million in funding—to support our independent delivery service partners and\n",
    "# their drivers, Amazon Flex participants, and temporary employees under financial distress.\n",
    "# In March, we opened 100,000 new positions across our fulfillment and delivery network. Earlier this week, after\n",
    "# successfully filling those roles, we announced we were creating another 75,000 jobs to respond to customer\n",
    "# demand. These new hires are helping customers who depend on us to meet their critical needs. We know that\n",
    "# many people around the world have suffered financially as jobs are lost or furloughed. We are happy to have\n",
    "# them on our teams until things return to normal and either their former employer can bring them back or new\n",

    "# airport and learned about an opening from a friend who is an Amazon operations analyst. Dallas preschool\n",

    "# happy to have Darby with us until she can return to the classroom.\n",
    "# Amazon is acting aggressively to protect our customers from bad actors looking to exploit the crisis. We’ve\n",
    "# removed over half a million offers from our stores due to COVID-based price gouging, and we’ve suspended\n",
    "# more than 6,000 selling accounts globally for violating our fair-pricing policies. Amazon turned over information\n",
    "# about sellers we suspect engaged in price gouging of products related to COVID-19 to 42 state attorneys general\n",
    "# offices. To accelerate our response to price-gouging incidents, we created a special communication channel for\n",
    "# state attorneys general to quickly and easily escalate consumer complaints to us.\n",
    "# Amazon Web Services is also playing an important role in this crisis. The ability for organizations to access\n",
    "# scalable, dependable, and highly secure computing power—whether for vital healthcare work, to help students\n",
    "# continue learning, or to keep unprecedented numbers of employees online and productive from home—is critical\n",
    "# in this situation. Hospital networks, pharmaceutical companies, and research labs are using AWS to care for\n",
    "# patients, explore treatments, and mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 in many other ways. Academic institutions\n",
    "# around the world are transitioning from in-person to virtual classrooms and are running on AWS to help ensure\n",
    "# continuity of learning. And governments are leveraging AWS as a secure platform to build out new capabilities\n",
    "# in their efforts to end this pandemic.\n",
    "# We are collaborating with the World Health Organization, supplying advanced cloud technologies and technical\n",
    "# expertise to track the virus, understand the outbreak, and better contain its spread. WHO is leveraging our cloud\n",
    "# to build large-scale data lakes, aggregate epidemiological country data, rapidly translate medical training videos\n",
    "# into different languages, and help global healthcare workers better treat patients. We are separately making a\n",
    "# public AWS COVID-19 data lake available as a centralized repository for up-to-date and curated information\n",
    "# related to the spread and characteristics of the virus and its associated illness so experts can access and analyze\n",
    "# the latest data in their battle against the disease.\n",
    "# We also launched the AWS Diagnostic Development Initiative, a program to support customers working to bring\n",
