      "Now these independently owned dealerships are out of pocket an estimated $10 million, having provided 2,295 rebates to customers and expecting to get reimbursed, according to the Canadian Automobile Dealers Association (CADA).\n",

      "But far uglier than the fruit and veg at our local organic food shop are the prices; up to three times higher than fresher looking produce at the local market. Kale the price of a steak, a blotchy heirloom tomato as expensive as a cup of coffee. But that's not really the point. Shopping there makes those who can afford it feel good.\n",
      "By picking through this motley harvest and hauling it home in their electric cars before the worms finish their work, the moral shopper knows they're doing the right thing. Good luck to them, too. But isn't something broken when only the wealthy can purchase with a conscience?\n",
      "Ethical consumerism - once a moral imperative before it was hijacked by companies as another marketing strategy - is back in the news with Tesla sales slumping around the world by as much as 70 per cent.\n",
      "Elon Musk's man-crush on Donald Trump has disillusioned Tesla owners. After buying his vehicles because they believed Musk stood for something, they're going elsewhere because he bent the knee, his bizarre onstage Nazi-style salute and drooling over the German far-right dismaying many European customers.\n",
      "If you can afford a Tesla - high-end models break the six-figure barrier - you can also afford the moral outrage. But in a cost-of-living crisis, most people's wallets don't extend to being woke. For many the choice is no longer about swapping a petrol guzzler for an EV, it's between keeping the family car running or using public transport.\n",
      "The sad truth is that shopping with a conscience is no longer about saving the planet or improving health. It's become an emblem of wealth, a badge signalling a privileged life, just like that Tesla logo.\n",
      "Putting aside the lousy quality of so much organic produce, one of the greatest frustrations about trying to buy ethically is that the burden too often lies with the individual.\n",
