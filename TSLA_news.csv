"Tesla Motors Hires Doug Field, Apple's VP of Mac Hardware Engineering, to Lead New Vehicle Development",2013-10-24T18:55:07Z,"Upstart automobile manufacturer Tesla Motors has announced the hiring of Doug Field, former vice president of Mac Hardware Engineering, to lead its development of new vehicles.

Field has been at Apple for more than 5 years and led the development of recent models of the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and iMac -- all of which have seen significant redesigns in past years.



""Doug has demonstrated the leadership and technical talent to develop and deliver outstanding products, including what are widely considered the best computers in the world,"" said Elon Musk, Tesla co-founder and CEO. ""Tesla’s future depends on engineers who can create the most innovative, technologically advanced vehicles in the world. Doug’s experience in both consumer electronics and traditional automotive makes him an important addition to our leadership team."" ""Until Tesla came along, I had never seriously considered leaving Apple,"" said Field. ""I started my career with the goal of creating incredible cars, but ultimately left the auto industry in search of fast-paced, exciting engineering challenges elsewhere. As the first high tech auto company in modern history, Tesla is at last an opportunity for me and many others to pursue the dream of building the best cars in the world—while being part of one of the most innovative companies in Silicon Valley.""

Field began his career at Ford as a development engineer after graduating MIT, before moving on to Segway and then to Apple.",https://www.macrumors.com/2013/10/24/tesla-motors-hires-doug-field-apples-vp-of-mac-hardware-engineering-to-lead-new-vehicle-development/
Mercedes Supersized ‘Hyperscreen’ Display Aims to Outdo Tesla's Hallmark Touchscreen Ola Kallenius,2013-09-10T18:30:00Z,"Daimler AG's unveiled a new display screen on Thursday that will cover almost the entire dashboard of its luxury Mercedes-Benz models, in a bid to outdo Tesla's hallmark touchscreen infotainment system.

In a video presentation, Daimler Chief Executive Ola Kallenius said the new Hyperscreen - which at 56 inches (142.24 cm) in width dwarfs Tesla's vaunted 17-inch screen - will make its debut in the EQS later this year, Mercedes' new fully electric sedan.

The EQS, with a driving range of 700 kilometres (435 miles), will be the first in a family of four vehicles built on the same all-electric platform.

""There's huge customer demand for this screen,"" Kallenius told reporters on a conference call. He said the dashboard would be an optional feature in the EQS, ""but we expect a very high take-up rate,"" from buyers.

As well as including vehicle functions such as the speedometer, music, and navigation features, the screen will allow passengers to access some vehicle functions and, in some markets, to watch television without disturbing the driver.

Kallenius said besides revenue from the screens themselves, Daimler expects future profitable growth of subscription services, such as maps or entertainment customers will download.

""It is part of our business strategy to increase this profit pool of recurring revenues,"" he said.

Tesla has dominated global electric vehicle sales and traditional carmakers like Daimler have been pushing to develop vehicles to compete for market share.

The pressure to outdo Tesla has been heightened by tighter emissions standards in the European Union and China, and the decision by a growing number of countries to start banning sales of new petrol or diesel cars as early as 2030.

Elon Musk Dogecoin Support on Twitter Makes Cryptocurrency Soar 50 Percent,2014-07-17T18:30:00Z,"Cryptocurrency Dogecoin surged more than 50 percent on Thursday after billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk tweeted his support for it, two days after he said he was to take a break from Twitter ""for a while"".

Dogecoin jumped to $0.05798 (roughly Rs. 4) according to data on blockchain and cryptocurrency website Coindesk. Musk first tweeted ""Doge"" and immediately followed it up with ""Dogecoin is the people's crypto"".

Dogecoin is the people's crypto — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 4, 2021

The Tesla chief's tweets about certain companies and cryptocurrencies have sent their prices soaring in recent weeks. Shares in GameStop, Etsy, and CD Projekt have jumped following comments on his Twitter account about them.

In the crypto world, him putting a ""#bitcoin"" tag on his Twitter bio sent the most popular currency flying last Friday. He has since taken the tag off.

Meanwhile, rival cryptocurrency ethereum is also on a record setting spree as investors buy it before the launch of ethereum futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange next week.

Ethereum rose to record high of $1,698.56 (roughly Rs. 1.2 lakhs) before giving up some of those gains to trade 2.7 percent lower in early london trading. Bitcoin, the most popular crypto currency, also fell 1.2 percent to $37,184 (roughly Rs. 27 lakhs).

Cryptocurrencies are gaining traction with more mainstream investors. The euphoria boosted the total market value of all cryptocurrencies above $1 trillion (roughly Rs. 72,97,400 crores) for the first time earlier in January.

"Tesla CEO Confirms 'Conversations' With Apple, Says Any Acquisition 'Very Unlikely'",2014-02-20T01:55:30Z,"Following a report earlier this week suggesting Apple had considered purchasing Tesla, Tesla CEO Elon Musk today confirmed in an interview with Bloomberg Television that his company ""had conversations"" with Apple. Musk went on to say that he could not comment on whether the conversations had revolved around any kind of acquisition, but he did confirm that at the current time, an acquisition of Tesla seems ""very unlikely.""

If one or more companies had approached us last year about such things there's no way we could really comment on that. We had conversations with Apple, I can't comment on whether those revolved around any kind of acquisition.



News of Apple's meeting with Tesla first came to light over the weekend, when the San Francisco Chronicle reported Musk had met with Adrian Perica, Apple's head of acquisitions, and possibly Apple CEO Tim Cook. While the site speculated the meeting pertained to a possible acquisition, other sources have since suggested Apple may have been meeting with Tesla over iOS device integration in the company's electric cars or about a potential battery deal between the two.

As noted by The Los Angeles Times, Musk last month announced plans for a massive lithium-ion battery plant, which will be constructed in partnership with ""some other companies."" Tesla is expected to make an announcement about the plant later this month, and it's possible Apple, which uses lithium-ion batteries for many of its portable devices, could be involved in that venture.

If there was a scenario where it seemed like it would be more likely that we would be able to create the mass market sort of affordable, compelling car then possibly it would make sense to entertain those discussions. I don't currently see any scenario that would improve that probability, so that's why I think it's very unlikely.

When asked whether Tesla was for sale, Musk told the interviewer that an acquisition was unlikely because the company needs to stay ""super focused"" on its goal of creating an affordable electric car, though he did not rule out the possibility of an acquisition entirely.

Apple CEO Tim Cook recently said the company is open to making large acquisitions if it makes sense, but he has also said that Apple will focus on the very few products that ""deserve all our energy."" Apple currently holds nearly $160 billion in cash while Tesla has a market cap of approximately $24 billion.",https://www.macrumors.com/2014/02/19/tesla-ceo-acquisition-unlikely/
Here's How BMW and Porsche Plan to Beat Tesla,2015-12-07T18:12:01Z,"The future of automotive technology won’t be dictated only by the experiments and blue-sky ideas of Elon Musk.

Automakers in Germany know this, and intend to disrupt whatever perceived control the Tesla CEO has in the electric vehicle game.

On Friday, Porsche OK’d production on its first “100 percent electrically powered” vehicle, while earlier in the month, BMW chief Harald Krüger criticized Tesla’s autopilot feature, saying that his company will unveil superior autonomous driving tech when its plans are fully hatched.

While competition is something that Musk welcomes, he can’t be especially thrilled about Krüger taking rhetorical jabs at Tesla’s autopilot software.

Krüger’s disdain might be somewhat plausable from a competitor playing catch-up — especially so when examining Autopilot’s somewhat tenuous, albeit positive beginnings — but he believes that BMW will develop self-driving technology, and roll it out more seamlessly than Tesla — which has come in for criticism as well as “life-saving” praise.

Speaking with German website Handelsblatt, Krüger likened Tesla to a player in the “app-industry,” which it is not:

“In the app industry, you can launch products on the market that are 70 to 80 percent ready and then complete their development with the customer. That is absolutely impossible with safety features in a car.

Autopilot is still in its beta-phase, adapting steadily as more Teslas dot highways across the world. Krüger claims that BMW’s rebuttal to autopilot won’t follow a similar trajectory, though, noting that “our technology must be 100 percent reliable,” before it hits the market.

BMW Chief Executive Harald Krüger Getty

The BMW i3 is the company's first electric car. BMW

BMW released the its own electric vehicle, the i3, in 2013, and the company’s BMW 7 series maintains a self-parking function.

Porsche also poses a threat to Tesla, and announced Friday it would start production on its large-scale EV project called Mission E. Porsche executives weren’t quick to fling any barbs in Tesla’s direction, although they’re touting the Mission E prototype vehicle, in addition to the company’s new Factory 4.0 — which will extend production on electric motors following a 700 million Euro investment — as the “dawn of a new age.”

Porsche extolled the Mission E’s specs in a press release on Friday:

“In concept form, the four-door car with four individual seats has a system power output of over 600 hp (440 kW). The vehicle thus is expected to achieve both acceleration of 0 to 100 km/h in under 3.5 seconds with a planned maximum range of more than 500 kilometers. When charged using an 800-volt charger unit which is planned to be specially developed for the car, which is twice as powerful as today’s quick-charge systems, the lithium-ion batteries integrated within the vehicle floor could be recharged to the 80 percent level after just 15 minutes.”

Both BMW and Porsche will enter the EV fray with a decidedly trusted brand and legacy of customer satisfaction, but they’ll likely be scrambling to match what Tesla has already cemented for itself: The company unveiled the size and scope of its gargantuan production facility — the Gigafactory — last month, and hopes to be producing 500,000 vehicles by 2020.

German automakers will also have the arduous task of overshadowing the glut of nearly 1,000 Tesla chargers already lining highways across the United States.",https://www.inverse.com/article/8917-how-bmw-porshe-plan-to-beat-tesla
"Elon Musk: If You Don't Make It at Tesla, You Go Work at Apple",2015-10-09T01:18:59Z,"In a new interview with German newspaper Handelsblatt (via Business Insider), Tesla CEO Elon Musk spoke about his thoughts on the much-rumored Apple Car. Additionally, Musk was asked what he thought about Apple hiring away some of Tesla's ""most important engineers.""



Important engineers? They have hired people we’ve fired. We always jokingly call Apple the “Tesla Graveyard.” If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple. I’m not kidding.

Musk was then asked whether he takes Apple's car ambitions seriously, to which he joked ""did you ever take a look at the Apple Watch?"" He went on to say that it was good Apple was moving toward and investing in a car and that it's the ""next logical thing"" for the company to offer ""significant innovation.""

The Tesla CEO went on to poke fun at the newly announced Apple Pencil and iPad Pro, saying that innovation in the form of a new pencil or a bigger iPad are ""not relevant enough."" However, Musk cautions that cars are far more complex than smartphones and smartwatches. ""You can't just go to a supplier like Foxconn and say: Build me a car,"" Musk told the German newspaper.

Apple and Tesla have hired each other's employees over the course of the last year, with Musk saying that Apple has hired away ""very few people"" from the car company despite offering $250,000 signing bonuses and 60 percent salary increases to its employees.

Virtual reality gear Tesla Suit hopes to make gaming a lot more touchy-feely,2015-05-12T16:00:14Z,"Video game technology continues to find ways to make things more interactive with the recent releases of VR headsets such as the Oculus Rift and Sony’s Project Morpheus. Still, even with those immersive improvements players aren’t getting a full sense of their virtual environments.

For example, playing a first-person shooter without the actual fear of feeling a bullet slam into your chest can never quite compare to a realistic experience. And even the richest game-world textures can’t match the real thing if you can’t touch them with your own two hands.

UK development team Tesla Studios (no connection to the cars) is aiming to fill those gaps between reality and virtual reality with the Tesla Suit; a full-body haptic feedback device allowing you to touch game environments and characters and let them touch you all over your body.

The main component of the Tesla Suit is the T-Belt which acts as the suit’s control unit. The belt is completely wireless and is intended to connect with all major brands of game consoles, VR headsets, and smartphones as well as PCs.

The belt also analyses your muscles in real-time, takes your temperature, gives massages, contains a motion capture system, corrects your posture, performs other data transmission, and – last but not least – it’s machine washable!

The next key piece in the Tesla suit is the T-Glove which provides haptic feedback and motion sensing much like the T-Belt. With these gloves you can touch things in the game which will transmit the sensation to your hand. The T-Glove is instrumental in providing tactile interaction between players.

For example, let’s say we were playing Call of Duty and I suddenly decided to stop with all the bloodshed and have us settle our differences with a tickle fight. My T-Gloves would be able to actually feel your ribcage with my fingertips so I could administer tickles with deadly precision. Meanwhile, your T-Belt would receive my tickle attack data and transmit it directly to your midsection, all in real-time.

▼ Oh generic Tomb Raider facsimile…I’mna give you such a pinch!



In addition to the T-Belt and T-Glove, the Tesla Suit is made up of several bands for the arms and legs. Spaces in between will be filled by a smart textile which contains a motion capture system and thousands of small points that deliver a wide range of pressures from a gentle breeze to a swift kick, along with temperature sensations.

The individual components all operate together wirelessly with each other and external devices using Bluetooth 4 LE. The belt runs on an ARM Cortex micro-controller.

Tesla Studios say that the first modules will hit the market around the middle of this year. Each piece of the Tesla Suit from the belt to the smart textile vest is considered an independent module apparently sold separately. However, they don’t say which (if not all) of those modules will be out first. The preorder section on their website is not open…yet.

There’s also no word on what kind of price tag this setup will come with, but for those looking for a true escape from reality it looks worth it. Imagine feeling the heat exhaust of an RPG hit your forehead as you launch, or the feeling of a chocobo’s back between your fingers as you saddle up for adventure.

The best would be if you were playing the new Silent Hill game and you suddenly feel something brush against your back in a dark hallway. Oh, wait. Forget that last one…

"In major reversal, New Jersey allows Tesla to sell its cars directly, without dealerships",2015-03-18T18:32:56Z,"Almost exactly one year after it was banned from selling its cars directly in New Jersey, Tesla will be back in business in the Garden State. Governor Chris Christie signed into law a bill this afternoon that reversed last year’s ban. The new legislation comes with some limits. Tesla can only open a total of four direct sale dealerships and has to operate at least one service center. But it’s a major win following a heated war of words that saw Tesla CEO Elon Musk compare local dealers to a mafia protection racket subverting the democratic process.

A huge victory in New Jersey for consumer choice: We are open for business! @GovChristie — Tesla Motors (@TeslaMotors) March 18, 2015

New Jersey represented the fourth largest market for luxury automobiles — like Tesla’s Model S, which can tip the scales past $100,000 — trailing only New York, Florida, and California. So it’s a key win for the electric car company. Bans on direct sales have kept Tesla out of Virginia, Arizona, Texas, and Michigan. Legislators in some of those states are working on legislation similar to the reversal just passed by Christie.

Musk has argued in the past that direct sales are key to building out a fledgling industry. “We strongly believe it is vital to introduce our own vehicles to the market because electric cars are still a relatively new technology. This model is not just a matter of selling more cars and providing optimum consumer choice for Americans, but it is also about educating consumers about the benefits of going electric, which is central to our mission to accelerate the shift to sustainable transportation, a new paradigm in automotive technology.”

Local auto dealers saw things differently. “If you’re an internet billionaire, maybe you think the world revolves around you, and the world springs from your laptop,” Jim Appleton, the president of the New Jersey Coalition of Automobile Retailers, told The Verge last year. “Well, I got news for him. This is not a new law, Tesla is operating illegally, and as of April 1st, they will be out of business unless they decide to open a franchise.”

Of course, Musk also believes cars operated by humans will eventually be illegal. It’s unclear how we’ll shop for cars in a future where we never get to drive them.

Update: The New Jersey Coalition of Automobile Retailers sent along the following statement:",https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/18/8251821/tesla-new-jersey-direct-sales-dealerships-christie
Apple Working On Project That Will 'Give Tesla a Run for its Money' Says Employee,2015-02-09T23:07:25Z,"Following last week's news of a mysterious Apple-leased vehicle roaming the streets of Northern California, an Apple employee has given some details to Business Insider, suggesting Apple is working on a project that will ""give Tesla a run for its money.""

After writing about how the van could be used for a self-driving car, we got an unsolicited email from an employee at Apple about ""vehicle development"" at the company. [...] ""Apple's latest project is too exciting to pass up,"" the person said. ""I think it will change the landscape and give Tesla a run for its money.""

According to the site's source, who was verified to be an Apple employee, Tesla employees are ""jumping ship"" and choosing to work at Apple because of this unidentified project.

Last week's pictures unveiled a van that appeared to have multiple cameras on the top, similar to the vehicles Google uses for mapping. Given the van's similarity to other mapping vehicles, rumors have suggested that it is likely for an unspecified mapping project. Apple has been working to improve Maps in recent months, and it's possible the company is working on a feature that would compete with Google Street View.

Other speculation has ranged a bit more towards the fantastical, suggesting that Apple is perhaps working on a self-driving car , but this seems unlikely due to Apple's tendency to focus on just a few products at a time. ""We have zero issue coming up with things we want to do, said Tim Cook last January. ""We must focus on the very few that deserve all our energy.""

As Business Insider suggests, one probable project that could pique the interest of former Tesla employees is CarPlay. CarPlay, which brings an iOS-style interface to in-car infotainment systems, is still very much in the early stages. In the future, CarPlay, which is being built directly into many cars, could expand to offer a Tesla-style feature set. With the Tesla iPhone app, Tesla owners can turn on heating, lock and unlock doors from afar, flash the lights, and more.

Deeper integration between iOS and in-car systems is also easily imaginable, given Apple's desire to allow users to transition easily from device to device, as with its new ""Continuity"" iOS 8/OS X Yosemite feature. In October, Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted at an expansion of Continuity and suggested it would be incredibly important going forward. ""Use your imagination and think about where Continuity goes,"" he said.

Given the ambiguity of the employee's statement, it is, of course, possible that the project in question is not even car-related and is something all together different.

Earlier this month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk directly contradicted the Apple employee's suggestion that Tesla employees are tempted by what Apple has to offer. In a report outlining the many employees Tesla has poached from Apple, Bloomberg spoke to Musk, who said ""very few people"" had left Tesla for Apple, despite Apple's offer of a $250,000 signing bonus and 60 percent salary increase.",https://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/09/apple-project-tesla-competitor/
"Apple, Tesla Fighting Over Top Employees",2015-02-06T02:48:51Z,"Apple and Tesla have been battling to recruit top talent from each other, according to a new report from Bloomberg Business. Tesla has hired at least 150 former Apple employees, more than they have from any other company.

The company has hired at least 150 former Apple employees, more than from any other company, even carmakers. The former Apple staffers work in many areas of the 6,000-employee automaker, including engineering and law. “From a design philosophy, [Apple] is relatively closely aligned,” says Musk, Tesla’s co-founder and chief executive officer. Apple declined to comment for this story.

Former Apple employees say their decision to join Tesla was based on the company's electric cars and CEO Elon Musk, who is a similar figure to Jobs. Like Jobs, Musk pays a great deal of attention to the details of his products and is a strong, visionary leader. Musk reportedly has a soft spot for Apple and enjoys comparisons to Steve Jobs as well, one former Tesla employee tells Bloomberg.

Apple's influence can be felt in the 17-inch touchscreen installed in Tesla's cars as well as its retail stores, both of which had former Apple employees in key roles. High profile former Apple employees at Tesla include Doug Field, Apple's former VP of Mac Hardware Engineering, who leads new vehicle development at the car company. Using top Silicon Valley talent, like former employees at Apple, allows Tesla to get a leg-up on competitors in the automobile industry.

While Tesla has had success recruiting talent from Apple, Musk says that Apple has hired ""very few people"" from the car company despite offering $250,000 signing bonuses and 60 percent salary increases to its employees.

Apple and Tesla have interacted in the past, with a report emerging in February 2014 that Apple had considered purchasing Tesla. Musk also revealed the two companies have had ""conversations"", though it isn't known whether those were about a potential acquisition, iOS integration in Tesla cars or battery technology.

The report also provides an interesting look into other ways Apple has influenced one of the most talked about companies in Silicon Valley and is worth reading at Bloomberg Business.",https://www.macrumors.com/2015/02/05/apple-tesla-employee-poaching/
Tesla unveils residential ‘solar roof’ with updated battery storage system,2016-10-29T00:49:56Z,"Tesla will build and sell its own line of solar panels to combine with its battery storage system, the company announced at a press event at Universal Studios in LA, today. The system will allow residential homeowners to replace their entire roof with solar panels connected to an updated Powerwall 2 battery pack, making it much simpler for homes to be entirely powered by solar power.

The roof is made of a textured glass tile with integrated solar cells. The roofs look “as good or better” than conventional roofs, according to Musk. They look like normal roofing tiles from the ground, but are completely transparent to the sun. The tiles are hydrographically printed, which, Musk says, makes each one a “special snowflake tile,” and no two roofs will be the same. “You can take any two roofs that look like that and they will be different — because they are different,” said Musk.

""Check out this sweet roof."" - Elon Musk

There are a number of different versions of solar panels: Textured Glass Tile, Slate Glass Tile, Tuscan Glass Tile, and Smooth Glass Tile. Tesla says its glass tiles are much more durable than conventional roof tile — something that’s important in areas with risk of hail.

The products are a “joint collaboration” between SolarCity and Tesla, according to SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive. Tesla is attempting to acquire SolarCity for $2.6 billion and shareholders of both companies will vote on the proposed acquisition in the middle of November.

The Powerwall 2 can store 14 kWh of energy, with a 5 kW continuous power draw, and 7 kW peak. The battery is warranted for unlimited power cycles for up to 10 years. It can be floor or wall mounted, inside or outside. It can be used for load shifting or back-up power.

Musk says there are three parts to the solar energy solution: generation (solar panels), storage (batteries), and transportation (electric cars). Musk’s plan is to sell all three of those products through Tesla.

Those wishing to go entirely solar, with minimal draw off the electrical grid, would need to buy solar panels from a separate company (like SolarCity) as well as Powerwall batteries from Tesla. Now, customers will be able to buy both products from Tesla directly.

Musk says there are four to five million new roofs built each year in the US, and the solar roof product will be price competitive with more traditional roofs with solar added to it. However, existing roofs which do not need to be replaced will be better candidates for more traditional roof-mounted solar solutions.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who announced the Powerwall 2 in the California sunshine, had previously teased the product in a series of tweets as well as the Tesla Motors “Master Plan, Part Deux,” earlier this summer.",https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13463236/tesla-solar-roof-battery-new-elon-musk

How Future Tesla Owners Will Escape Range Anxiety,2016-06-14T17:20:00Z,"No matter how much battery technology improves, charging an electric vehicle will never be as fast as filling up a tank of gas. The laws of thermodynamics simply won’t allow it, not even for Elon Musk and Tesla.

The rate of energy transfer can only get so fast — for car batteries, that means a minimum of around 10 minutes charging time. If you try and go faster, the charging becomes too inefficient and generates a high level of heat, which means lost energy.

“There are fundamental limits as to how fast one could ever charge a battery pack,” Venkat Viswanathan, assistant mechanical engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, tells Inverse. “We can never get to the 30 second or two minute time frame you have for fuel filling.”

But, Viswanathan says, that is no reason to be pessimistic about the future of electric vehicle traveling. Yes, even on long distance trips.

The infrastructure problem accompanying the technology problem

Tesla’s supercharger network is the fastest, most advanced network in the United States. But it isn’t everywhere and it only works with Teslas.

Owning an electric vehicle is “very much like having a cell phone that you can only charge at the office or in coffee shops,” Tesla owner Will Schenk writes on the Tesla blog. “Kind of weird, takes a little bit of planning, but it can work.”

When the relatively low-priced Tesla Model 3 comes out and more people are able to utilize the Supercharger infrastructure, that planning will have to be based around approximately 215 miles per charge. The number of Superchargers (and regular chargers that are just as capable, if slower) is growing every year, but areas of the Midwest still have long, range-anxiety producing stretches.

Completely charging a battery takes over an hour. That’s a lot of time to give up every 200 or so miles, and before many people feel comfortable investing in an electric vehicle, they need to know they can go the distance.

People will still have to stick to urban streets for that lower priced, smaller battery Model S in the short term.

“I think the breakthrough in charging technology will probably start after the adoption of electric vehicle increases a little bit, or after we have bigger batteries,” Mehrnaz Ghamami, assistant professor of engineering at Michigan State University, tells Inverse.

Battery swapping: speed vs. reliability

Tesla looked into a battery swap program in the early days of the company. By 2013, it only took 90 seconds, or about half the time it takes to fill a tank of gas, to swap a battery out of a Model S. Despite the progress, the program was largely abandoned by 2015.

That’s because batteries, in a sense, have a memory of how it was used and what conditions it experienced in the past.

“Say I used a battery for 10,000 miles and another person used their battery for 10,000 miles and we do a battery swap,” Viswanathan says. “One would think they’re indistinguishable, but they’re not.”

A battery exposed to cold weather, hot weather, and heavy stop-and-go traffic will have more degradation than a battery in temperate California. A 90-second swap could result in you paying for a less efficient battery.

The best use for a battery swap, says Ghamami, is for an electric ride-share fleet. So battery swap is a good idea if Lyft and GM’s plan to eliminate car ownership entirely with a fleet of autonomous electric Chevy Bolts works out. If not, an extensive Supercharger infrastructure or some future technology is more likely to be the answer to range anxiety.

Wireless charging: The long term solution

Plugging in is a modern inconvenience. Sure, it’s what you might call a first world problem, but when wireless charging advances enough it could change the entire way that cities are designed.

Wireless charging will never be as fast or as efficient as plugging into a Supercharger. More energy is lost in the transfer from charger to car. Ubiquitous wireless chargers could mean never needing to intentionally charge though.

Plugless, one of the foremost companies working on wireless electric vehicle charging, has successfully worked with a variety of companies from Google to Hertz rental service. Once the technology advances enough, it’s not hard to imagine having something like Plugless under every parking spot in town. Going to the local vape outlet isn’t just running errands, it’s getting your car ready for the next trip you take.

Eventually, chargers could even be put in roads to charge electric vehicles while they drive. As with Superchargers, infrastructure is just as important as the technology. How it will be paid for, which lanes will be dedicated, and how it will affect traffic conditions all have to be taken into account. It’s no small task for future generations if that path is taken.

For now, electric vehicle owners will have to calm their range anxiety with proper trip planning and avoiding places without public chargers. Electric vehicles are just on the edge of what is possible.

“We are not quite there,” Viswanathan says, “but all of the right factors are in place for us to be able to set up an infrastructure to make long distance trips more seamless.”",https://www.inverse.com/article/16980-how-future-tesla-owners-will-escape-range-anxiety
Tesla Design Studio Lets You Customize a Model X,2016-04-12T17:26:00Z,"Elon Musk and Tesla really know how to keep the hype from dying. Today, Tesla released its “Design Studio,” where prospective buyers can design their own Model X, for the United States market.

The Design Studio currently only works for the Model X 75D, 90D, and P90D. Despite not including the much anticipated Model 3 or the stylish Model S, the Design Studio is like a nostalgic trip to early internet days of designing your own sneakers — only much, much more expensive.

The studio website comes at a convenient time for Tesla. Yesterday, Tesla informed 2,700 early Model X buyers about a factory recall on the third row of seats. But you know what they say, if you don’t like what people are talking about, change the conversation. What better way to change the conversation to capitalize on the Tesla-buying frenzy of the past couple weeks than with a personalized online buying experience?

It’s hard not to check all the boxes when the upgrades and options are laid out for your hypothetical choosing. The best (most expensive) Model X you can custom design can easily jump into the triple digits.

You want four 22-inch Onyx-black wheels on your P90D? Sure thing, that’ll be $4,500 extra. Pearl-white paint job? $1,500, and an additional $2,600 for the matching white leather seats. Of course, the exterior is only the beginning. After upgrading for Ludicrous Speed ($10,000), Autopilot ($2,500), the premium Bioweapons Defense mode ($4,500), high fidelity sound ($2,500), the High Amperage Charger ($1,500), and every other available upgrade, it costs $151,750 to buy your Design Studio Model X in cash. The estimated delivery date — which may or may not be reliable — is the month of May. The “hubris” of adding too much tech slowed the production of Model X in the past, so maybe this isn’t the best option.

If you stick to basics for the 75D (meaning don’t do any of the actual customizing that the Design Studio was made for), it will cost $83,000 and be delivered sometime in June.

So fresh and so clean. Tesla

The Design Studio is one of those things you want to experience on a full computer screen. It isn’t optimized for the phone, and constantly zooming in and out on the fine print to decide whether “ventilated front seats that circulate cool, dry air through perforations in the seating surface” are worth it can get tedious.

So if all the recent Tesla talk has you wanting to buy one of your own, head on over to the Design Studio. For everyone who can’t afford one, there’s no harm in living vicariously through checking all the boxes.",https://www.inverse.com/article/14140-tesla-design-studio-lets-you-customize-model-x
Why is the Tesla Model 3's dashboard so weird?,2016-04-01T20:59:59Z,"Judging from the $200 million in deposits Tesla has already raked in, the Model 3 has quickly found its fans in the last 24 hours — so quickly, in fact, that Elon Musk is openly wondering how he’ll make all those cars.

Don’t get me wrong, the car looks nice (complaints about the grille-less front end aside). And from the all-too-brief moment I spent in it as a passenger last night, I get the impression that this is probably going to be a great car, just like the Model S before it. But I can’t stop thinking about the dashboard, a spartan expanse of absolutely nothing broken only by a steering wheel and a plain 15-inch touchscreen on a floating mount that looks like it could’ve been pulled off a Lenovo workstation pilfered from an office cubicle. In place of the instrument cluster, the driver has to sneak peeks at the speed by glancing at a widget in the upper left of the big screen.

Although there are ongoing debates about the safety and ease of use of the portrait-mounted, 17-inch touchscreen found in the Model S and X, at least they’re mounted in attractive, functional dashboards. In fact, the interiors of the S and X look phenomenal. But instead of hewing close to those interiors with the 3, Tesla went in a pretty radically different direction.

Why’d they mess with a good thing?

The obvious explanation is that Tesla had to cut corners to bring the Model 3’s base price down to the promised $35,000, and I do think there’s probably an element of that. But a $35,000 car is still not a cheap car, and if you look across the auto industry at $35,000 vehicles, you’ll see a lot of attractive interiors.

Another plausible explanation is that the interior simply isn’t done. That is true: there will be more to this car by the time it’s released a year and a half from now, but I was told by a Tesla staffer at last night’s event that the dash is essentially production-ready in its current state. In other words, the details may change, but the overall concept isn’t likely to change much; I would be shocked if a traditional instrument cluster magically sprouted between now and late 2017.

The remaining explanation, I believe, is the biggest one: the Model 3 is a self-driving car.

In his relatively short, fast-paced presentation last night, Elon Musk took time to note that every Model 3 off the line will be equipped with Autopilot hardware and have safety features like emergency braking enabled as standard. (Perhaps full-on Autopilot will be an extra-cost software option, as it is on the Model S.) That gives Tesla the better part of two years to collect high-definition mapping data and refine algorithms from the Autopilot-equipped Model S and Model X vehicles that are already on the road.

In other words, Autopilot — and systems like it — are going to get a lot better over the next couple years. Then the Model 3 launches, and before you know it, you’ve got a few hundred thousand Model 3 owners letting their cars do the highway driving for them.",https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/1/11348960/tesla-model-3-interior-touchscreen-self-driving-theory-autopilot
China is trying to build an empire of electric cars-but the strategy has one huge flaw that will benefit Tesla,2016-03-10T20:30:18Z,"The Chinese government is going all in on electric cars. After all, China is currently plagued with some of the worst air pollution in the world.

It’s also one of Tesla founder, Elon Musk’s prime targets for the company’s global expansion.

While the Silicon Valley-based automaker has made a name for itself selling high priced, high performance electric cars, Musk’s goal has always been to become more like Henry Ford than Enzo Ferrari.

This means Tesla’s future will be in the production of mass market vehicles for the everyday consumer rather than niche luxury supercars.

However, the real growth in China’s electric car market has been in the form of something a considerably more pedestrian than even Tesla’s slowest model — the low speed electric car or LEV.

According to Bloomberg’s Adam Minter, the Chinese government is going as far as regulating these cars with a top speed of just 43 mph.

“The boom in low-speed electric vehicles (or LEVs) is an unplanned disruption in a Chinese auto market accustomed to central planning,” Minter wrote.

“LEV makers are out-innovating and out-selling their upscale electrified counterparts. Production of LEVs is growing quickly, and sales exceeded 300,000 in 2014, accordingto state media, far outpacing estimates of traditional electric-car sales.”

At the same time, Tesla’s China sales have been tepid at best and will likely remain that way for some time. But Elon Musk need not worry. The Chinese government is fully committed to electric cars. Plus, the LEV and Tesla’s consumer base will likely have little to no overlap.

Much of China’s LEV market is aimed at the country’s rural and secondary or tertiary cities. They will be crucial in replacing the millions of dirty two-stroke gasoline powered vehicles as well as tiny Kei car-based city runabouts prevalent throughout China. Furthermore, many of these LEVs will be deployed as taxis and commercial vehicles.

Tesla, on the other hand, will target a decidedly more affluent and urban clientele. The middle and middle-upper class of China’s megacities are not pining for the chance to buy an LEV golf cart. But, they may one day, dream of owning a shiny new Tesla.

Your Tesla Will Park Itself Better Than You Could,2016-02-09T04:26:58Z,"Elon Musk really, really doesn’t want you to park your own car. Last month, the Tesla founder and CEO announced that the Model S and Model X versions of his zero-emissions supercars would receive the “Summon” function, allowing owners (we won’t be able to call ourselves “drivers”) to call their cars out from garages at the press of a button.

In a blog post today, Tesla announced that the Summon feature is only getting better, now allowing the vehicle to perform fine-tuned maneuvers in tight spaces and in reverse, relying on its ultrasonic sensors to perform better than the human eye, especially when the driver is outside the car with a “direct line of sight.”

Basically, Tesla is letting you get out and help your buddy parallel park, something humans have been doing for decades, except now your buddy is a semi-autonomous robot car designed by a guy who wants to live on Mars.

Tesla hopes that the new Summon software will help cut down on human error accidents that frequently happen in reverse, citing a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration survey that found cars backing up caused over 900 deaths and 52,000 injuries from 2008-2011 in the U.S. alone.

The latest blog post also said Summon functions could be used to get Tesla vehicles into tighter parking and storage spaces. Their idea is for occupants to get out first, allowing the car to squeeze into a space where the doors are inaccessible. In theory, this sounds efficient, but Tesla does not address how annoying it might be to return to your non-Summonable vehicle to find it sandwiched between two gleaming future-mobiles with no room to open the doors.",https://www.inverse.com/article/11217-your-tesla-will-park-itself-better-than-you-could
SpaceX Falcon Heavy Will Take Tesla Roadster to Mars,2017-12-22T22:22:00Z,"What sounded like a prank when SpaceX CEO Elon Musk first floated it earlier this month became real Friday: His car is headed to outer space.

Musk confirmed on his Instagram that the long-awaited first flight of SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy rocket in January 2018 will carry Musk’s own midnight cherry-colored Tesla Roadster as its payload.

Mars is the mission’s destination, though it won’t actually be touching down on the Red Plant. It will instead be going into a billion-year orbit around our planetary neighbor.

Oh, and Musk revealed his car will be looping David Bowie’s “Space Oddity” — a favorite of at least one astronaut — throughout the journey. It’s a fitting anthem to this monumental mission, though presumably he is saving “Life on Mars” for when SpaceX starts building Musk’s planned Martian’s settlement.

All of this was tweeted out by Musk on December 1. But the tech mogul is known to have some prolific Twitter fingers, leading observers wondering if this was nothing more than a joke.

After all, the Falcon Heavy’s launch has been pushed back several times, so it would be understandable if SpaceX carried out the mission in as straightforward and low-key a way as possible. But in classic Musk fashion, he has decided to go with the flashier approach.

Any doubts that Musk wouldn’t be rocketing his Roadster into outer space were quelled Friday. He posted pictures on Instagram of his electric car situated between rocket’s payload fairings, which are the blast shields found at the tip of the rocket that are used to protect payloads.

Regardless of what’s inside the Falcon Heavy, a successful launch would break records in the aerospace sector. Its 27 Merlin engines are capable of generating 5.1 million pounds of thrust at full power. This would make it the most powerful currently operational rocket in the world. Musk recently three three Falcon Heavy photos that show its massive size.

SpaceX also plans to be able to recover the rocket cores used for this test launch, allowing them to continue using this rocket for future space missions to the moon and Mars. If all goes to plan, all three boosters will land upright back on Earth, Musk teased on Twitter recently: “Two cores return to base doing synchronized aerobatics. Third lands on droneship.”",https://www.inverse.com/article/39711-elon-musk-falcon-heavy-tesla-roadsters-mars
"Tesla Roadster Might Be Able to Fly, Elon Musk Tells Twitter Followers",2017-11-20T14:40:00Z,"It seems Tesla CEO Elon Musk has some ideas about how to use the rocket expertise of his SpaceX venture and apply it to Tesla’s range of electric cars. The second-generation Roadster, surprisingly unveiled last week, promises acceleration times of 0-60 miles per hour in just 1.9 seconds, which would make it the fastest-accelerating production vehicle in the world. But of course, Musk wasn’t satisfied with merely that. The car should also be able to fly. Musk created a stir on Sunday when said there’d “special upgrade” for the new Tesla Roadster that would take its performance to the “next level.”

“Not saying the next gen Roadster special upgrade package will definitely enable it to fly short hops, but maybe…” Musk told his 15 million Twitter followers. “Certainly possible. Just a question of safety. Rocket tech applied to a car opens up revolutionary possibilities.”

“Rocket tech applied to a car”

It’s a surprise suggestion from the entrepreneur who famously shunned flying cars in the wake of news about the flying car system being developed by Uber.

“If somebody doesn’t maintain their flying car, it could drop a hubcap and guillotine you,” Musk said in a February interview with Bloomberg. “Your anxiety level will not decrease as a result of things that weigh a lot buzzing around your head.”

In April, Musk repeated the “guillotine” line TED conference in Vancouver.

“This is not some inherent bias against flying things but there is a challenge with flying cars in that they’ll be quite noisy, the wind force generated will be very high, let’s just say that if something’s flying over your head, if there are a a whole bunch of flying cars all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation.

“You don’t think to yourself, ‘well, I feel better about today.’ You’re thinking, ‘did they service their hubcap? Or is it going to come off and guillotine me as they’re flying past?’”

“‘Did they service their hubcap? Or is it going to come off and guillotine me as they’re flying past?’”

It offers acceleration times of 0-100 in 4.2 seconds, a quarter mile in 8.8 seconds, and a 200kWh battery pack capable of running for 620 miles on a single charge.

The new Roadster — unveiled at the Tesla Semi truck launch — promises a staggering list of record-beating specs when it launches in 2019 at a starting price of $200,000.

“We started Tesla with a sports car, the Tesla Roadster. That baby got us going. It was the foundation of the whole company,” Musk said. “People have asked us for a long time, ‘When are you going to make a new roadster?’ We are making it now.”

The earliest this new Roadster will arrive isn’t for a few years, though. Musk said the sports car won’t hit the streets until 2020, but naturally, one can reserve one today, via a “Founders Series” vehicle will sells for $250,000. More details about that quarter-million-dollar Roadster won’t be out until next year, Musk said: “We’re gonna talk about things beyond base maybe next year sometime.”

“‘When are you going to make a new roadster?’ We are making it now.”

Not everyone was too pleased about Musk’s attempt to drum up hype on Twitter around the forthcoming electric car.

“Settings expectations high again I see,” the Model 3 Owners Club fansite responded, going on to name various promised features of the $35,000 Tesla Model 3 that launched this summer which were missing from the final design, like a “spaceship” steering wheel.

Quite how Musk plans to develop a “short hop” Roadster while avoiding the “guillotine hubcap” issue remains to be seen, but it seems that safety is the main reason why Tesla has avoided joining the likes of Google co-founder Sergey Brin in exploring the technology. There’s also the distinct possibility that Musk, ever the salesman, is trying to drum up reservations in the days following the debut of the Roadster.

Either way, we probably shouldn’t expect a flying Tesla taxi along the lines of what Uber’s developing.",https://www.inverse.com/article/38569-elon-musk-hints-tesla-roadster-flying-car
Tesla’s new second-generation Roadster will be the quickest production car ever made,2017-11-17T05:27:47Z,"Elon Musk promised a surprise during the Tesla semi unveiling event, and boy did he deliver: the return of the Roadster. But it’s no repeat performance. The stunning four-seater roadster boasts jaw-dropping numbers, that if they measure up to Musk’s claims, will make it the world’s quickest production car. In his remarks, Musk described it as a “smackdown” to the fossil fuel-addicted auto industry.

will likely cause Porsche and Ferrari to break a sweat

The finale to his semi truck reveal was all about driving home that point. As the opening guitar licks of the Beastie Boys’ “Sabotage” blasted over the loud speaker, a beam of red zipped across the parking lot. The second-generation Tesla Roadster came to an abrupt halt, and a grinning Elon Musk came back on the mic to introduce his latest baby, which will likely cause Porsche and Ferrari to break a sweat.

Musk claimed the base model will do 0 to 60 in 1.9 seconds. If true, that would make it the first production vehicle to crack the two-second threshold. He also said the new Roadster would climb from 0 to 100 mph in 4.2 seconds, and will clear the quarter mile in 8.9 seconds (in case the Fast & Furious drag race franchise comes calling).

“It’ll be faster than that jet over there,” Musk quipped, as an airplane soared over the exultant crowd crammed into Tesla’s Hawthorne, California facility.

“It’ll be faster than that jet over there”

Musk said he wouldn’t confirm the top speed, but hinted that it was “above 250 mph.” By comparison, the Agera RS by Sweden’s Koenigsegg currently holds the world record at 277.9 mph.

As fans gasped, Musk said the Roadster had a 200kWh battery pack and a 620-mile range per charge, or over 1,000 kilometers. Again, another record shattered — or so Musk claims. Imagine driving from Los Angeles to San Francisco and back, without recharging, Musk teased.

The vehicle has three motors (one in the front and two in the rear), all-wheel drive, and torque steering.

The design is clear strike against the sports car industry. There are possible cues from all the majors players, including a McLaren P1 cockpit, an Acura NSX exterior, Bugatti Chiron headlights, a Targa-like roof, and a rear reminiscent of an Aston Martin DB10.

“The point of doing this is to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars.”

“The point of doing this is to give a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars,” Musk said. Driving any other turbo-charged sports car, is going to feel like a steam engine with a side of quiche.

But there is a wait: Musk said production isn’t scheduled to start until 2020, and production deadlines at Tesla have traditionally been optimistic. You can reserve one now for $50,000 towards the $200,000 base price – or get one of the first 1,000 Founders Series models with more performance and an asking price of $250,000 that has to be paid now.

While Model 3 customers wait, Tesla has dug in its heels and reminded its fans where the brand love all began: the 2008 Roadster. Musk has been teasing the return of Tesla’s first production car since 2011, when the vehicle ended its run. But the promised date of 2014 came and went, and instead, the electric automakers fans got the Model S, followed by the X and the 3. This evening’s semi truck unveiling was meant to signal the next stage in Musk’s “Master Plan.” As Musk has shown time and again he has learned the art of flipping the script by delivering heavy on delight.

This is the Tesla Semi truck,2017-11-17T04:47:07Z,"The Tesla Semi truck is a hulking and menacing hauler, with the presence of Darth Vader lurking from above when cast in the black hue, or more like an apparition in metallic silver-white. In other words: it’s exactly what we expect to see from Tesla, as it attempts to make a semi truck that lives up to the brand’s DNA of making the future seem cool.

I sat in the driver’s seat hours before the truck was revealed at Tesla’s Hawthorne, California facility on Thursday. Apart from the glass area and the two screens on either side, it feels as badass as any big truck. The center-mounted seat, however, does feel weird. I noticed several elements from the Model 3, including a turn signal and gear lever, but it had a different steering wheel since it doesn’t require an airbag.

The center-mounted seat does feel weird

Whether Tesla can actually impact the freight truck market remains to be seen, but design is certainly part of that statement, as Tesla makes it clear that it wants to do things differently — staging a full-scale media event blitz to emphasize that point — it is perhaps the first reveal of an 18-wheeler to take the stage to the tune of trance music. Tesla is taking a page from its Model 3 playbook (a game plan that’s currently a roll of the dice), but it’s one that tends to generate tons of hype and whip the media and Musk fans into a frenzy.

It’s a delicate moment for Tesla, with both fans and investors watching the rollout of its first mass-market car intensely. Now they are tuning in to see a truck, because it’s Tesla. The usual audience for freight innovation is far more niche. But when Elon Musk talks trucks, his fans whistle and shout.

The reveal event was held in the shadow of two of Musk’s other pet projects: SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket and a mile-long hyperloop tunnel. Both served as reminders that this was no ordinary company, and no ordinary truck.

Musk appeared Thursday night in Hawthorne, California, to show off his company’s newest vehicle, promising a range in the neighborhood of 500 miles for the Class 8 heavy-duty vehicle. Earlier reports pegged the range between 200 and 300 miles, but Musk delighted in besting those numbers in his remarks, including his claim that the truck has a 400-mile range with 30 minutes of charging. Musk had also promised self-driving abilities, and Tesla says this delivers at least semi-autonomous capability.

Tesla showed not one, but two trucks

In the hours before the official reveal, Tesla showed not one, but two trucks to journalists ahead of the unveiling: a standard model and another with an aerodynamics package. There were tense moments leading up to the reveal, with Tesla employees buzzing around nervously.

The vehicles were parked in a studio facing up to competing diesel-powered trucks from Freightliner and International. Compared to the internal combustion engine models, the Tesla Semi has smoothed-off sides covering its electric parts, including the grille up front. Yes, there’s a “frunk” up there, with some storage and access points for some service repairs. The door handles are flush-mounted, too, because they come off a Model 3.

The streamlined look of the Tesla Semi truck is made possible by the battery pack mounted under the floor of the cab, and the driver’s seat mounted significantly more forward than of those the Freightliner or International trucks. Behind the cab, the two rear axles have electric motors attached on either side, for four in total. They also come off of existing Tesla models. The design gives the Tesla Semi truck a lower center of gravity than diesel-powered models, something the company has said about its cars relative to rivals with internal combustion engines. While this is unlikely to make a semi truck handle like a sports car, it may go some way toward increasing high-speed stability.

Inside, a driver’s seat is centrally mounted with a passenger’s behind and to the right of it. This contrasts with the conventional trucks that have two seats mounted side by side, but with little room left in the cab for other storage. Tesla designers say they maximized the space left over from the battery pack’s positioning to create more space to walk around inside, as well as creating more storage — something decided after the company spoke to commercial truck drivers. There isn’t a version with sleeping accommodations, however, but it sounded like a future model change might include this feature.

Two screens dominate either side of the steering wheel, also from the Model 3. On the semi truck, however, the screen to the left controls vehicle functions and settings specific to the trunk portion, while the one on the right has more typical navigation and radio controls. A Tesla official indicated those could be made more configurable in the future.

Enhanced Autopilot is standard

While there are large, conventional truck mirrors mounted outside the vehicle, each interior screen shows images of the sides of the truck through cameras mounted under the exterior mirrors. Tesla says those are part of the Autopilot system (there are also forward-facing cameras mounted at the base of the windscreen), but they will likely help drivers get used to sitting in the middle of the cab.

After the reveal, it’s clear Tesla hopes its innovative packaging and approach will resonate with truck drivers and fleet managers who are tired of the way the vehicles have been designed for decades. After all, it won’t be alone in the electric truck market. Companies with experience in large trucks, such as Cummins and Daimler, have already announced plans for electrified models, with immense pressure coming from cities and countries anxious to reduce air pollution in heavily populated areas.

The appearance of a large truck that breaks into completely uncharted territory for Tesla comes at a time when its last big announcement, the Model 3 sedan, has yet to be delivered to the roughly 500,000 customers who’ve paid $1,000 to reserve the car. Tesla and Musk have been on the defensive over the last several weeks after admitting to “production hell” at the Fremont assembly plant and the Nevada Gigafactory, where the batteries are assembled. Model 3 production hurdles were one of the reasons given when in October Musk postponed the semi truck reveal to this evening. Tesla also reported earlier this month its worst financial quarter ever, losing nearly as much money so far this year as it did in all of 2016.

Telsa has already secured an order for four of its trucks from Meijer Inc, the big-box chain headquartered in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Each reservation required a $5,000 deposit, according to Bloomberg.

What Tesla has done today is shown that it wants to invigorate a segment, rather than just make something to comply with more stringent emissions regulations. Through the design and packaging alone, Tesla is applying some of its most notable brand cues to a type of vehicle it’s never made before. And in the process, it’s trying to do for heavy-duty commercial vehicles what it did for luxury cars — plough forward in its own lane.",https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16667366/tesla-semi-truck-announced-price-release-date-electric-self-driving
Former Tesla factory workers allege racial harassment in new lawsuit,2017-10-17T20:17:26Z,"Three former employees of Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California, claimed they’ve suffered constant, often daily racial discrimination and harassment, and that the electric car company did little to nothing to stop the behavior. The allegations were made in a new lawsuit that was filed yesterday in California’s Alameda County Superior Court; it names Tesla and three staffing agencies as defendants. The suit was first reported by Mercury News.

In the lawsuit, the three men — who are all African-American — say they were “thrilled” to join Tesla, “an innovative and groundbreaking company that is at the forefront of the electric vehicle revolution,” but allege that they were repeatedly subjected to racial slurs and racist drawings by co-workers and even superiors. It was a “scene straight from the Jim Crow era,” they claim.

The three men listed as plaintiffs in the suit are Owen Diaz, who was employed as an elevator operator at the Fremont factory between June 2015 to May 2016; his son Demetric Diaz, who was a production associate between August 2015 and October 2015; and Lamar Patterson, who was an elevator operator between January 2016 and August 2016.

One of the plaintiffs provided an image of a drawing to ‘The Mercury News’

In an email, a Tesla spokesperson says that “none of these individuals has ever brought a claim about their time at Tesla until now, in some cases years after they were last at Tesla.” The plaintiffs argue otherwise in the suit. Demetric Diaz, who was employed by West Valley Staffing Company, claims he was subjected to the n-word regularly, and that the company “took no action.” He also says he addressed the issue with his supervisor at Tesla, which he claims led to him being issued a written warning and, eventually, being fired for “breaking the rules.” (Demetric Diaz is also suing for wrongful termination.)

Owen Diaz argues in the lawsuit that Tesla employees “drew racist and derogatory caricatures of African children that resembled the ‘pickaninny’ imagery of the early twentieth century,” and Mercury News’ report on the lawsuit includes a photo of one of these drawings credited to him. He lists a number of other times he was subjected to racial slurs, and also claims to have reported these to both his supervisor and his employment agency to no avail, which is why he eventually quit.

Robertson argues that he, too, was subjected to racial slurs, encountered “racist caricatures, images, and effigies around the factory,” and was told to “go back to Africa.” He claims to have reported all this to the same supervisor as Owen Diaz.

The “only somewhat relevant evidence we have found,” Tesla says, “is an email from Owen Diaz to his supervisor from October 2015 in which Mr. Diaz claimed that a co-worker was yelling and making aggressive comments. That email made no mention of the use of any racist language or epithets.”

Tesla also says that these employees “were at Tesla for only a short time and have been gone for well over a year,” and reiterate that they were technically employed by third-party staffing agencies.

In the suit, the plaintiffs argue that each staffing agency should be considered a “joint employer” and “integrated enterprises” with Tesla to the point that “the actions of one entity can be and are attributable to the other.” For example, Patterson was employed by Chartwell Staffing Services Inc. but says that he received “training and orientation directly through Tesla, clocked in and out using Tesla’s timekeeping system, and Tesla maintained power over hiring and firing decisions.”

The plaintiffs argue that the staffing agencies and Tesla should both be held responsible for any wrongdoing

A second racial discrimination lawsuit was filed earlier this year by a different man who was represented by the same attorney, Lawrence Organ. In response to the new suit, Tesla denied the claims, and questioned the motives of the attorney and the actions of his clients.

Tesla said that “timing of these new claims and the manner in which they are being publicized is notable,” and that Organ “timed [the previous lawsuit] to coincide with a carefully planned media blitz in an attempt to create a disingenuous narrative that was at odds with the facts.”

“Tesla’s trying to make this story about civil rights lawyers, instead of civil rights,” Organ told the The Verge in response. “This is about stopping people at Tesla factories from using the n-word, plain and simple.”

Tesla is still in the middle of lawsuit from former employee who alleged that women experienced “unwanted and pervasive harassment.” And just last week, the company fired hundreds of workers — which the company claims were based on performance — in a time that CEO Elon Musk has described as “production hell” as it attempts to ramp up production of the Model 3.

”No employee should ever feel harassed or mistreated based on their race, gender, beliefs or anything else,” the Tesla spokesperson wrote today. “There are over 33,000 people working at Tesla, and given our size, we recognize that unfortunately at times there will be cases of harassment or discrimination in corners of the company. For there to be zero cases in a global workforce of 33,000 would be impossible for any company, no matter how much we care. And we care a lot, particularly given how hard everyone at Tesla works to do what most regard as impossible.”

The full lawsuit filing is below.

Why is there no Nobel Prize in technology?,2017-10-04T15:39:58Z,"As the world focuses its attention on this year’s recipients of the planet’s most prestigious prize, the Nobel, it feels like something’s missing from the list: technology.

Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel established the prizes more than century ago with the instruction that his entire estate be used to endow “prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind.” The categories laid out in his will—physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, and peace—have remained the basis of the awards, and a prize for economics was added in 1968.

But life has changed dramatically in the 118 years since Nobel died. Since the first prize was given in 1901, the industrial era has passed and the information age is now well and truly upon us. Humanity has become an urban species, with more than half the world now living in cities, carbon pollution has pushed greenhouse gases to the highest concentrations ever recorded, and the mobile phone has become the quickest and biggest technology uptake in human history. Almost 4 billion people are now online, and since 2015, data flows have driven more global economic growth than the entire physical goods trade.

No prizes for the automobile, lightbulb, plane, mobile phone, or the internet, and no recognition for the genius of Tesla or Edison.

Technology is at the source of all these changes, yet there’s still no prize for technologists. No prizes for the automobile, lightbulb, plane, mobile phone, or the internet. None for the inventor of the modern combine harvester or the team that sequenced the first human genome. Despite being responsible for inventions that have fundamentally altered the course of human history, no recognition for the genius of Nikola Tesla or Thomas Edison.

Every now and again a technologist does sneak in, usually in the physics category. Guglielmo Marconi, for example, got a prize in 1909 for the radio transmitter, and the creators of the transistor (1956), laser (1964), semiconductor (2000), and the LED (2014) have all received physics Nobels, too. The exception however, proves the rule. Over the awards’ history, they’ve been given to 881 people, only 28 of whom have been engineers or technologists.

So, what gives? Why only those five original fields? Nobel didn’t say, revealing only that he made his choices “after mature deliberation.”

One way of looking at it is that when he was designing his categories, he wanted the prizes to only reflect advances in fundamental science. In this view, “lesser” sciences such as biology, geology, or computer science—or technology-driven fields such as engineering or robotics—don’t qualify. As genome-sequencing pioneer Eric Lander once said, “You don’t get a Nobel Prize for turning a crank.”

But what then of literature and peace, or the newer prize for economics (an applied science at best, and a pseudoscience at worst)?

Technology isn’t the only field to get the cold shoulder. Mathematics—the international language, the foundation of so many scientific pursuits, and arguably the most fundamental theoretical discipline of all—doesn’t have a Nobel Prize, either. Mathematicians have complained about this for decades. One story suggests that Nobel disliked the Finnish mathematician Rolf Nevanlinna, and assumed that he would be the first winner of the mathematics prize, if he decided to award one. Alternatively, math undergraduates are often told that Nobel was jealous of a Swedish mathematician who had an affair with his wife (though this story is ruined by the fact that Nobel didn’t actually have a wife).

Assuming Nobel wasn’t motivated by petty jealousies, he may have thought that mathematics was a kind of technology itself: a tool used in the sciences and in engineering rather than a body of human intellectual achievement. And yet history has shown that view to be wrong: Some of the greatest scientific achievements of the past two centuries, from Einstein’s theory of relativity to the discovery of the Higgs Boson, rose directly out of fundamental advances in mathematical theory.

Despite this, the Nobel Foundation says it’s unlikely that they’ll ever add any more categories. According to Jonna Petterson, head of PR at the Nobel Foundation, after the addition of the sixth prize for economics, “the board of directors decided to keep the original five prizes intact and not to give permission to any additions.” Other organizations give out genius medals in STEM—mathematics has the EMS Prize and Fields Medal, engineering has the Queen Elizabeth Prize, computer science has the Turing Prize, and technologists have the Millennium Prize—but nothing gets attention like a Nobel.

While the Nobel is supposed to recognize brilliant research done in the past, it’s also meant to recognize people who have conferred the greatest benefit to humanity. In an age when technology is intimately interwoven in almost every aspect of our lives, those who come up with new ways of using technology to make the world a better place deserve just as much recognition as the scientists, doctors, peacemakers, economists, and writers who we’re celebrating this week.

So in honor of those who won’t be acknowledged, here’s a list of 25 technologists and inventors who didn’t get a Nobel, but fit the criteria for inventions that have conferred the greatest benefit to humanity.

Tesla’s long-serving battery tech chief has stepped down: report,2017-08-01T19:18:42Z,"is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

Kurt Kelty, director of battery technology at Tesla, has stepped down from his post just days after the company’s lavish party to celebrate the delivery of the first Model 3s, Bloomberg reports. Kelty, who has worked at Tesla since 2006, led Tesla in forging partnerships and battery cell material sourcing at the company’s Gigafactory near Reno, Nevada. He was also responsible for the overall performance of Tesla’s batteries.

“We can confirm that Kurt Kelty has left the company to explore new opportunities and we want to thank him for everything he’s done for Tesla,” a company spokesperson told The Verge by email. “Kurt’s responsibilities will be distributed among Tesla’s existing teams.”

Prior to joining Tesla, Kelty worked at Panasonic for nearly 15 years. At Tesla, Kelty served as lead negotiator with Panasonic for that facility, according to LinkedIn. Earlier this year, he accepted the award for “Battery Innovator of the Year” presented by the 34-year-old International Battery Seminar.

Kelty’s departure couldn’t come at a worse time for Tesla, which is finally entering what CEO Elon Musk calls “production hell” for the Model 3. Musk has promised that Tesla will produce 100 cars in August, more than 1,500 by September, and then 20,000 per month by December. If the company fails to hit these marks or runs into manufacturing issues that happen at higher scales, or demand for the Model 3 drops, analysts argue it would be a setback not just for Tesla, but perhaps the entire electric vehicle movement.

Here’s a video of Kelty talking about battery production at the Gigafactory back in March 2017:",https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/1/16078566/tesla-battery-tech-chief-departs-kurt-kelty-model-3
The Tesla Model 3 interior doesn't look like any car you've ever seen,2017-07-29T04:53:39Z,"Tesla finally delivered the first 30 units of the Model 3 this past evening, and now that the production version of the company’s mass-market electric car is out in the wild, one key detail has finally been confirmed: the interior is going to look unlike anything else on the market. There’s one 15-inch, bezel-free, horizontally-oriented touchscreen panel — and that’s it. No instrument cluster, no heads-up display. The rest of what’s in front of you is just a smooth dashboard and a the windshield.

CEO Elon Musk had warned as much on Twitter since last year’s initial unveiling that the interior of the production version of the Model 3 would look as spartan as the prototype. And he has been steadfast in his confidence that people will like it, at one point telling a fan outright that “you won’t care” that there’s no instrument cluster or HUD. Still, it’s hard to imagine it won’t take some adjusting for anyone who’s driven a car before, because all the basic information you need while driving is now slightly more than just a glance away.

Considering Musk’s concerted push to make Tesla’s cars autonomous, it’s not surprising that he’s willing to bet that stripping the typical creature comforts from the interior of the Model 3 will be fine. “You won’t really need to look at an instrument panel all that often,” Musk said during the Model 3 handover event, adding that people will eventually be able to “watch a movie, talk to friends, go to sleep” in Tesla’s cars.",https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/29/16061480/tesla-model-3-interior-video-display-screen-photos
Tesla's Autopilot software head leaves the company six months after joining from Apple,2017-06-21T02:56:57Z,"Chris Lattner, a longtime Apple software guru, has left his post running software for Tesla’s Autopilot division after just six months. Lattner announced his departure in a tweet late Tuesday. Earlier in the evening, Tesla announced that it had hired leading AI expert Andrej Karpathy as the company’s new director of AI and Autopilot. Karpathy had previously been a researcher at OpenAI, a nonprofit effort to advance artificial intelligence started by Musk and other Silicon Valley veterans.

“Turns out that Tesla isn’t a good fit for me after all,” Lattner wrote. “I’m interested to hear about interesting roles for a seasoned engineering leader!”

A Tesla spokesperson confirmed Lattner’s departure, adding that “Chris just wasn’t the right fit for Tesla, and we’ve decided to make a change. We wish him the best.” Jim Keller, who oversees hardware for Autopilot, will take on Lattner’s duties in the meantime.

Lattner joined Tesla at a crucial time for Autopilot

Lattner joined Tesla in January as the vice president of Autopilot Software. The electric car company hired him away from Apple, where he notably led the development of the Swift programming language. At the time of tweeting about his departure, Lattner’s Twitter bio still referred to Tesla’s Autopilot software as “the new frontier.”

He joined Tesla at a crucial time for the company’s Autopilot software. Just months before, the manufacturer parted ways with Mobileye, an Israeli company that provided tech for the first version of Tesla’s semi-autonomous software. The split occurred after the two companies argued over which side’s tech was to blame for Autopilot’s failure in preventing the death of Josh Brown, a Tesla owner who died last summer after impacting a tractor trailer while using the self-driving feature.

Since then, Tesla has been rebuilding its own version of Autopilot without Mobileye’s tech. It was only earlier this month that CEO Elon Musk said that he thinks Tesla’s system was nearing the quality it once had with Mobileye’s tech integrated into its cars.",https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/20/15844280/tesla-autopilot-software-chris-lattner-ai-quit
"In Year Since Fatal Tesla Crash, Car Autonomy Has Gone Mainstream",2017-05-08T00:38:00Z,"On Friday, Tesla released a software update for vehicles that are equipped with second generation Autopilot. It bumps Autosteer’s highway speed limit up to 90 mph and off highway limit to 5 mph over the speed limit.

Elektrek reports that Tesla is also asking users to allow the company to collect short video clips using the cars’ external cameras. Tesla claims it won’t be able to identify what video clips belong to different models, and that the more on-the-road data they’re able to collect, the closer the company will be to a self-driving car reality.

Sunday also marks the one-year anniversary of Tesla’s Autopilot-related fatality. On May 7, 2016, Joshua Brown was killed when his Model S collided with a tractor-trailer near Williston, Florida, while using Autopilot. In January, the NHTSA cleared Tesla of wrongdoing in the crash. The final report noted that the car’s technology was not yet fully autonomous and that due to the perpendicular nature of the crash and the speed, Autopilot’s sensors were not provided adequate time to detect the hazard.

Still, the crash was a controversial moment for a company whose CEO Elon Musk has said that one of the fundamental purposes of autonomous vehicles is to decrease driver fatalities and accidents overall. Since the crash, Tesla has navigated safety concerns and continued to move toward its goal of a driverless future. The year since the crash has seen Tesla’s competitors launch aggressive efforts at autonomy and regulators at the state and federal level adopt formal guidelines for testing.

Below are a few of the biggest events in the rapidly evolving field of self-driving tech to occur since that crash a year ago.

Fully Autonomous Hardware

In October of 2016, Tesla announced that all new Tesla vehicles would now include the hardware necessary to be fully autonomous at a “safety level substantially greater than that of a human driver.”

Fast-Approaching Competition

Tesla may be seen as the leader in autonomous driving, but a lot of technology companies and automakers have started trying to get in on the action in the last twelve months.

In August, Ford announced its plan to mass-produce autonomous vehicles within five years and have them on the road by 2021.

In September, Uber launched a small run of its self-driving car service in Pittsburgh.

The Chinese search engine Baidu began publicly testing its self-driving BMW3 in November at the World Internet Conference in Wuzhen, China. Google’s self-driving car project got a boost and a new name in December. In January, we got a first look at a self-driving Chevy Bolt EV, Hyundai debuted an autonomous car that’s also part of your house, and BMW released its own automated driving system in a BMW 5 Series Sedan prototype.

Tesla also sued a start-up called Aurora Innovation in January, claiming the self-driving company stole data from Tesla in order to compete with the autonomy innovators.

During a panel discussion in January, Ford CEO Mark Fields alluded to the Tesla accident’s ability to scare off progress on autonomous vehicles, saying, “The one fear I have is if anybody in this industry tries to jump the gun and maybe get a beta-test product out there that — God forbid — has an event, an accident or something, that’s going to cause people to pause.”

In April, Cadillac announced that its CT6 sedans would come equipped with Super Cruise in 2018, a technology that will have hands-free driving.

Road Regulations

In September, the federal government released the first nation-wide set of rules for the manufacturing and sale of autonomous cars.

In March, the California DMV announced a new set of regulations for testing autonomous cars on public roads, as the state has essentially become the playground for self-driving innovators like Uber, Tesla, and Google. The announcement also outed all the other companies that were looking to test autonomous technology on California roads.

In April, Apple was added to the DMV’s list, implying that it is also now working more seriously on its brand of autonomous technology.

Hints About the Future

In April, Model 3 and Model S Teslas were spotted driving around with extra sensors, which could be used for compiling more data or facilitating an even more advanced Autopilot function.

At a TED talk in Vancouver on April 28, Musk expounded on a number of his current projects, as well as what we can expect from Autopilot in the near future. He said that Tesla cameras — models currently come equipped with eight — were the key to autonomous driving and that perfecting a “vision neural net” is a priority. “You can absolutely be super-human with just cameras,” Musk said. “You could probably do ten times better than humans with just cameras.”

He also said that Tesla was on track to start conducting self-driving car trips from New York to L.A. as soon as the end of 2017. Of course, regulations still inhibit this from becoming a consumer reality, but Musk says he’s getting close to bridging the technological gap that will sooth the public’s safety concerns. So much so, he believes that in two years Tesla owners will feel comfortable enough that they’ll even choose to sleep through most of a cross-country trip.

“The real trick of it is not how to make it work 99.9 percent of the time, if a car crashes one in 1,000 times you’re probably still not going to be comfortable falling asleep,” he said. “But if the car is unlikely to crash in 100 lifetimes, in 1,000 lifetimes, then people are probably like, ‘OK, wow, if I were to live a thousand lives, I would still most likely never experience a crash, then that would be ok.’”",https://www.inverse.com/article/31283-tesla-fatal-crash-anniversary

"Best Electric Bike 2018: Hands-on With the Mate X, the 'Tesla of E-Bikes'",2018-10-25T20:30:00Z,"Julie Kronstrøm Carton has become a key player in a transport revolution. She’s the Danish co-founder of Mate, the team behind the most crowdfunded electric bike in history. Long dismissed as obscure health machinery, e-bikes are increasingly rolling out of the shadows as an eco-friendly alternative form of transportation that’s easier on the legs than a conventional bicycle.

“We want to be the Tesla of e-bikes,” Kronstrøm told me in the lobby of a London hotel near the Olympic Park, as we waited to take the foldable bike out for a spin on the rain-soaked streets. “We want to be the brand you would think about, and I think compared to our size, we have managed quite well.”

Quite well is perhaps an understatement. The team posted its original Mate Indiegogo campaign two years ago, ending on October 10, 2016 with $6.8 million in funding, a staggering 4,320 percent of its original goal. The company has since sold over 8,000 of these bikes. The second campaign for the Mate X ended on September 29 this year and far surpassed all expectations, scoring just under $13 million in funding and reaching over 25,000 percent of its original goal. It’s the largest-ever European crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo.

With fundraising totals like that, it’s no wonder at all that electric bikes in particular are having something of a moment right now. Bike-EU, citing Cycleurope statistics, saw double-digit growth in European electric bike sales, with French sales jumping 50 percent in part thanks to a €200 ($231) government incentive. British folding bike maker Brompton recently released its own version after three years of development, declaring to The Guardian this month that “we’ve cracked it.”

Mate could find itself in a good position to ride this wave. At present, there’s three models of bike: the $2,199 Mate X 250, the $2,399 Mate X 250+, and the $2,699 Mate X 750, with special Indiegogo pricing at $899, $999 and $1,099. The first two come with a 250-watt motor, the latter with a 750-watt motor. While the cheapest has a 48-volt 11 amp-hour battery with a 35-mile range, the latter two come with a beefier 14 amp-hour pack capable of 55 miles, plus a quick charger.

As with other electric bikes, the aim is more about ride comfort than super-fast speed. The 250-watt models can reach 25 mph and the 750-watt models 30 mph, but they ship with speed limiters switched on by default to abide by regulations. In the United Kingdom, where Inverse tested the Mate X on the rain-soaked streets of London, the law limits e-bikes to 15.5 mph.

To develop their vision for the electric bike, Kronstrøm, 40, joined up with her brother Christian Adel Michael. It was an ideal partnership with roots in their childhood: Michael always had a passion for motors and mechanics, which Kronstrøm helped cultivate when she bought him an electric scooter as a confirmation present when he was 14. As this e-bike revolution kicked in, Michael decided to get on board — but he was disappointed at first.

“He was just looking at the market and what he found was… grandmother bikes with a huge battery, ugly as hell,” Kronstrøm says. “All the TV programs around e-bikes was always, if you have lung disease or you’re obese then you should go for an e-bike. If you really looked, there would be maybe one cool e-bike brand, and it would just be so expensive, double the price at least.”

It was the perfect opportunity to merge his background in product development with his sister’s experience as a city development consultant. The pair got help from a number of noteworthy sources, chiefly Christine Vardaros, a cyclist that’s represented the United States in more than 30 World Cups and World Championships, and who helped the team produce a series of instruction videos to show buyers how to use the bike.

The bike cuts an imposing figure in person. It’s a hefty chunk of steel, weighing 57.3 pounds without the battery and up to 63.9 pounds with the battery included. The bike is foldable, but even folded it still occupies a a lot of space. By comparison, Brompton’s offering weighs 36.6 pounds total. Nonetheless, the folding mechanism makes it ideal for storing in a space-constrained apartment, reducing the risk of leaving it out for thieves.

The Mate X folded. Mike Brown/Inverse

All that weight is not for nothing. The chunky wheels mean a smooth ride — a design feature requested by Mate’s American buyers, who made up 25 percent of sales for the first bike and 30 percent for the second. It also gives it a distinctive look, and one impressed passer-by stopped to chat with us during our tryout.

“It’s really rewarding and quite funny to see the impact that we’ve actually had on some people’s lives,” Kronstrøm says.

With a half-turn of the pedals, the bike motors kick in at one of six computer-set levels. At first, it’s quite unnerving to feel the bike move with such little force, but it quickly becomes second nature.

Slowing down the pedals also slows down the motor’s speed, making it feel like a smooth and natural ride. There’s also the option of a throttle (though not in my native Britain, again, due to regulations). There’s also eight-speed Shimano gears to enable use as a regular bike, meaning you’re not constrained to only using the bike when there’s a charged battery at hand. The use of such typical components should also simplify repairs further down the line, ideal for a small company like this.

It’s not all sunshine and rainbows. During our conversation, Kronstrøm mentions “passionate” customers that “get angry with you if there’s a problem.” The company’s Trustpilot page has a three-star rating based on an average of 325 reviews. The team also has a backlog of 10,000 Mate X orders from more than 25,000 contributors to ship to 70 different countries. The first 1,300 are in production, and Kronstrøm expects it to take another six months before the rest are ready.

Slamming on the brakes in the pouring rain, it’s quite a feeling to get to grips with what is essentially a new class of vehicle. As cycling infrastructure weaves its way through cities, Mate could be one of the first to capitalize on the next form of urban transportation.",https://www.inverse.com/article/50190-hands-on-with-the-mate-x-electric-bike
"SEC Sues Elon Musk For Fraud, Seeks To Force Him Out As Tesla CEO",2018-09-28T01:04:52Z,"Securities regulators have accused Tesla CEO Elon Musk of misleading investors with false statements, in a move that could result in his removal from the electric car company he helped launch 15 years ago.

In a lawsuit filed in federal court in New York, the Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Musk of committing fraud through public statements that hurt investors.

At issue was Musk’s tweet last month that he had secured funding and was thinking about taking the company private. That sent the company’s stock soaring, jumping 10% on the day of the social media blast

Contrary to his claims, Musk “knew that he had never discussed a going-private transaction at $420 per share with any potential funding source,” the SEC claims in its suit.

The SEC seeks to bar Musk from serving as an executive or director of a publicly traded company.

“This unjustified action by the S.E.C. leaves me deeply saddened and disappointed,” Musk said in a statement released by Tesla. “I have always taken action in the best interests of truth, transparency and investors. Integrity is the most important value in my life and the facts will show I never compromised this in any way.”

Tesla is not named in the suit, through the news caused more turmoil for the automaker, which has struggled to meet production targets for its mass-market Model 3 sedan and has yet to turn an annual profit.

Lucid Motors closes $1 billion deal with Saudi Arabia to fund electric car production,2018-09-17T14:31:17Z,"is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

Lucid Motors, the electric car startup that aims to compete with Tesla, will receive an eye-popping $1 billion in funding from Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the kingdom announced on Monday. The investment will finance Lucid Motor’s 2020 commercial launch of its first electric vehicle, the Lucid Air. Meanwhile, Tesla’s stock dipped by as much as 2 percent in early trading on news of the investment.

The deal is a major win for Lucid, which has languished over the last year as it failed to secure the funding necessary to start making its luxury electric cars. News of the talks comes weeks after Saudi Arabia purchased 5 percent of Tesla and emerged as a central player in Elon Musk’s failed effort to take the company private again. Musk cited conversations with the director of the Saudi fund as the impetus for his push to take Tesla private.

The deal is a major win for Lucid

Under the agreement, Lucid will use the funding to complete engineering development and testing of the Lucid Air; construct its factory in Casa Grande, Arizona; begin the global rollout of its retail strategy starting in North America; and enter production for the Lucid Air.

“The convergence of new technologies is reshaping the automobile, but the benefits have yet to be truly realized,” Peter Rawlinson, chief technology officer of Lucid (and a former executive at Tesla), said in a statement. “This is inhibiting the pace at which sustainable mobility and energy are adopted. At Lucid, we will demonstrate the full potential of the electric connected vehicle in order to push the industry forward.”

A spokesperson for the Saudi Public Investment Fund said: “By investing in the rapidly expanding electric vehicle market, PIF is gaining exposure to long-term growth opportunities, supporting innovation and technological development and driving revenue and sectoral diversification for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.”",https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869450/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-deal-tesla
"Mercedes-Benz Launches the EQC, a Fully Electric SUV to Compete With Tesla",2018-09-05T00:30:00Z,"Mercedes-Benz was not known as a leader in the electric car space, emphasizing instead its fleet of hybrids and its progress toward developing more fully autonomous driving. But that could very well change with the EQC, a new fully electric SUV that the company launched on Tuesday with plans to hit showrooms in the United States by 2020.

It’s the first vehicle that the European automotive giant has launched under its EQ brand (the “EQ” per a press release, stands for “electric intelligence”). It was formally introduced today at a premier event in Stockholm.

The new EQ is expected to have an estimated range of roughly 200 miles, according to the company, powered by a lithium ion battery with a capacity of 80 kWh. The car will be able to accelerate from zero to 60 mph in under five seconds, though these specs are just early estimates.

Mercedez-Benz's new electric car will boast a range of 200 miles, and will hit the roads some time in 2020. Mercedez-Benz

Will the EQ Be Able to Compete With the Model X?

At first glance, it seems like the EQ is meant to compete with the Tesla Model X, Tesla’s SUV which boasts a nearly 300 mile range and can seat up to seven people. In terms of towing capacity in particular, the Model X has turned heads, and it retails for more than $70,000 after accounting for the savings and tax credits. Jaguar’s I-Pace sells for $69,500, meaning it’s relatively safe to say that the EQ will also retail in the $70,000 range to be competitive.

Most of Tesla’s competitors have focused on higher end makes: Porsche recently unveiled the Mission E Cross Turismo at the Geneva Motor Show. Audi has also featured prominently in the electric car race, debuting a prototype of its E-Tron in March. It’s expected to have a 311 mile range.

These announcements show how the race to build the fully electric car is heating up, while also shedding light on how audacious Tesla’s ambition to develop and begin shipping its mass market Tesla Model 3 by this year really was. The push to ramp up production has taken a toll on the company, particularly CEO Elon Musk, though the company has met the summer’s production targets.

For its part, Mercedes-Benz executives told Bloomberg, it’s going “all in” on electric vehicles, with plans to have at least 22 fully electric makes by the year 2022. Audi plans to have 20 electric vehicles and hybrids by the year 2025.",https://www.inverse.com/article/48654-mercedes-benz-has-an-electric-car-the-eqc
This Man Was So Fed Up Trying to Get His Tesla Fixed That He Ended Up Doing It Himself,2018-08-28T10:33:09Z,"Greg Furstenwerth thinks of himself as a Tesla fan. But after months of waiting on parts and appointments for his out of warranty Model S, he decided to take repairs into his own hands.

Furstenwerth pre-ordered the Model S, and in 2013 became one of the first people to get the car in the state of Hawaii, he says. He later drove the electric vehicle across the United States before there was a Supercharger network. He did this, he said, to shut down the electric car haters who ceaselessly griped about range anxiety.

""Tesla used to call me,"" he remembers. ""They'd tell me, 'hey we noticed that there's something going wrong with your car.' Or when I had my flat they did their courtesy roadside service. They really took care of me, actually, as an original preorder. But as soon as I exceeded my warranty, the interactions all went away. I was treated like I didn't really own a Tesla.""

As an early Model S owner, Furstenworth is among the first to deal with service needs for this luxury electric car out of warranty. The company recommends all repairs go through its own service centers or authorized providers. But there can be long waits to get an appointment at a Tesla service center or get new replacement parts.

Because he lives on an island outside of Seattle, Furstenwerth getting into a Tesla service center required a long drive. He wouldn't always be guaranteed to have a loaner car to get him back home, either. Tesla did not offer its Tesla Rangers service, a kind of mobile mechanic that comes to an owners' house, where he lived.

So he looked to independents. He found, unfortunately, a dearth of professional mechanics willing and able to work on his Model S.

That's because Tesla doesn't make spare parts, diagnostic tools and even repair manuals readily available. After market parts aren't abundant, either. No major player manufactures these today.

The few who can fix a Model S, and even fewer who can fix a Roadster, are left to buy ""parts cars,"" and salvage parts from used Tesla vehicles. Some reverse engineer and make these parts with 3-D printers.

Furstenwerth, who says he has always been good at figuring out how to fix things himself, learned how to diagnose and fix his Model S by taking it apart and putting it together several times. While he has taken part in some online forums where Tesla owners discuss their issues and fixes, mostly he was on his own, with no car schematics or manuals from Tesla.

He found parts were available from some small suppliers online. But he had to track them down individually. Among his issues were leaking tail lights, failing door handles, a passenger window behind the driver that fell out of place and faulty wiring in his driver's side door.

He says if he had been able to get a timely appointment, he was looking at a minimum of $14,000 in costs. At one point, he even considered destroying the car.

""I was infuriated beyond belief because everyone told me that it was an impossible car to work on"" he said.

They were wrong.

""When I opened it up, I find out that it's the easiest car I've ever worked on. Easiest device I've ever worked on. They built a Lego car. It's like putting together Legos, taking apart Legos. If you can put together Legos you can put together a Tesla Model S.""

Now, Furstenwerth is thinking about how to help other out-of-warranty Model S owners fix their cars on their own, too.

""I want to see Tesla wildly succeed,"" he says. ""I have no problem with them being vertically integrated, and running things the way they do for cars that are in warranty. But if they want to get in the mass market, unless they're gonna run every single service center in every single small town, there's no way it's acceptable to have people for minor issues drive and kill an entire day to go to the service center, just for some free Keurig coffee.""

Since he fixed his Model S, he's put more than 2,000 miles on it, driving it from Seattle to Detroit, Michigan, he says.

Elon Musk says he’s been talking to Saudi Arabia about taking Tesla private,2018-08-13T14:01:14Z,"is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

After days of speculation and conflicting reports, Elon Musk has broken his silence about his plan to take Tesla private. In a Monday morning blog post, Musk explained that he has been in talks for weeks with managers of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund to finance the massive deal, which some estimate could cost as much as $50 billion. But it’s unclear whether Musk’s explanation will mollify federal regulators, who are reportedly looking into whether his statements from last week were misleading.

Musk said that the Saudis first approached him about taking Tesla private in early 2017, but only ramped up those talks in recent days after purchasing almost 5 percent of the company’s stock on the public markets. Musk said he took a meeting with the managing director of the fund on July 31st, where the director expressed regret that the going private talks hadn’t moved forward.

“He strongly expressed his support for funding a going private transaction for Tesla at this time,” Musk wrote. “I understood from him that no other decision makers were needed and that they were eager to proceed.” He added, “I left the July 31st meeting with no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed, and that it was just a matter of getting the process moving. This is why I referred to ‘funding secured’ in the August 7th announcement.”

“no question that a deal with the Saudi sovereign fund could be closed”

Musk also said, “Obviously, the Saudi sovereign fund has more than enough capital needed to execute on such a transaction.” But the Saudi fund’s solvency isn’t so obvious, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal. The fund is “struggling to find ways to finance its existing commitments,” the Journal reported, and sources cast doubt on the idea that the Saudis would increase their current stake in Tesla.

Last Tuesday, Musk sent shockwaves through the market when he tweeted that he was “considering” taking Tesla private “at $420” and that he has secured the funding to do so. The stock exchange briefly halted trading on Tesla shares as investors waited for more information. In a subsequent email to employees, Musk indicated that the tweet was serious, not just a weed joke. “The reason for doing this is all about creating the environment for Tesla to operate best,” Musk wrote.

Questions swirled about whether Musk was being entirely forthcoming about the massive amount of funding needed to take Tesla private. Frantic efforts to root out the funder (or funders) continued in the days since. The Securities and Exchange Commission reached out to the Tesla CEO for more information about what would be the largest corporate buyout in history. And rumors began circling about the possible involvement of the Saudis.

Those rumors turned out to be well-founded. Musk said that he has stayed in communication with the Saudi’s wealth fund about the deal subsequent to the July 31st meeting and has kept Tesla’s board of directors informed throughout the process. He reiterated his desire to provide a mechanism for current Tesla shareholders to remain shareholders even after the buyout. But Musk emphasized that a privatization deal has yet to be finalized, and everything could still change. After all, this is Elon Musk we’re talking about.

Another critical point to emphasize is that before anyone is asked to decide on going private, full details of the plan will be provided, including the proposed nature and source of the funding to be used. However, it would be premature to do so now. I continue to have discussions with the Saudi fund, and I also am having discussions with a number of other investors, which is something that I always planned to do since I would like for Tesla to continue to have a broad investor base. It is appropriate to complete those discussions before presenting a detailed proposal to an independent board committee.

He claimed that the deal would be financed with equity rather than debt, arguing that Tesla was saddled with enough debt at the moment. He estimated that “approximately two-thirds of shares owned by all current investors would roll over into a private Tesla.” And he dismissed reports that a buyout could cost as much as $70 billion, stating that they “dramatically overstate the actual capital raise needed.” But he did not clarify what the actual number might be.",https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17683104/elon-musk-tesla-private-saudi-arabia-deal
Former Tesla Lead Engineer Doug Field Returns to Apple to Work on Project Titan,2018-08-10T09:05:09Z,"Apple's former VP of Mac hardware engineering Doug Field has returned to the tech giant's ranks after five years working at Tesla, where he oversaw production of the Model 3.

Daring Fireball writer John Gruber broke the news on Thursday after speaking to an Apple spokesperson who confirmed only that Field had returned to the company that he left in 2013.



However Gruber's contacts within Apple informed him that Field will link up with former colleague Bob Mansfield to work on Apple's self-driving car program, Project Titan.

Field began his career at Ford as a development engineer, before moving on to Segway and then to Apple, and his return is already fueling speculation that Apple's self-driving ambitions have been rejuvenated under the leadership of Mansfield.

Rather than solely developing autonomous systems for existing car manufacturers, Apple's rehiring of Field could indicate that the company still retains an interest in building its own vehicles.

When Apple began working on Project Titan in 2014, upwards of 1,000 employees were said to have been working on developing an electric vehicle at a secret location near its Cupertino headquarters.

However, internal strife and leadership issues reportedly caused Apple to transition its focus to an autonomous driving system and pursue partnerships with existing carmakers instead of building a full car. Hundreds of employees were said to have been laid off as a result.

Little is known about the inner workings of Apple's Project Titan group, but court documents filed in July indicate that as many as 5,000 people are authorized at Apple to access information about the project.

Apple has also been significantly ramping up its fleet of vehicles running self-driving sensor equipment. As of May 2018, the company has 62 vehicles out on the road using its autonomous driving software.

Apple is also working on a self-driving shuttle service called ""PAIL"" (an acronym for ""Palo Alto to Infinite Loop""). The shuttle program will transport employees between Apple's office in Silicon Valley.",https://www.macrumors.com/2018/08/10/former-tesla-lead-engineer-returns-to-apple/
Elon Musk calls British diver in Thai cave rescue 'pedo' in baseless attack,2018-07-16T06:36:18Z,"Elon Musk came under fire on Sunday after launching an extraordinary attack on a British diver who helped rescue the boys trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand, baselessly calling him a “pedo” on Twitter and then doubling down.

Twelve boys and their football coach were rescued from the Tham Luang cave complex by an international team and after a week of intense drama.

The chief executive of the tech giant Tesla offered to assist the rescue mission by providing a submarine. The request was turned down. Musk lashed out on Sunday, saying he would make a video proving that his “mini-sub” would have been successful and adding: “Sorry pedo guy, you really did ask for it.”

The accusation, presented without evidence or context, was directed at Vern Unsworth, a British cave explorer who recently said Musk’s attempt to help the rescue effort was a “PR stunt”. No evidence has emerged to substantiate Musk’s claim of pedophilia.

“It just had absolutely no chance of working,” Unsworth said in a widely shared interview. “He had no conception of what the cave passage was like. The submarine, I believe, was about 5ft 6in long, rigid, so it wouldn’t have gone round corners or round any obstacles.”

Musk visited the cave system himself. Unsworth said the billionaire “was asked to leave very quickly”. He also told CNN Musk could “stick his submarine where it hurts”.

On Sunday, when a Twitter user pointed out that Musk was “calling the guy who found the children a pedo”, the billionaire responded: “Bet ya a signed dollar it’s true.”

Intense criticism followed. Some Twitter users pointed out how “dangerous” and irresponsible it was to make such a serious allegation and to broadcast a potentially libelous insult to his 22 million followers.

Spokesmen for Musk and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Later on Sunday, Musk deleted the “pedo” tweet and its follow-up.

Unsworth could not immediately be reached.

Some users reported Musk’s comments to Twitter, one saying he “shouldn’t be allowed to use Twitter to unleash [his] followers on people like this”.

Musk has repeatedly come under fire for his behavior on Twitter and for Tesla’s PR strategy, under which it aggressively attacks critics and journalists. James Anderson, a partner at Baillie Gifford, Tesla’s fourth-largest shareholder, said in a recent Bloomberg interview the company needed a period of “peace and execution”, adding: “It would be good to just concentrate on the core task.”

Asked about the “pedo” tweet, Anderson told the Guardian in an email: “I intend to convey my – predictable I trust – feelings to the company tomorrow.” He declined to elaborate.

Musk had pledged to be less combative on social media, saying earlier this week: “I have made the mistaken assumption – and I will attempt to be better at this – of thinking that because somebody is on Twitter and is attacking me that it is open season. That is my mistake. I will correct it.”



The billionaire attracted controversy for his approach to the Thai rescue after Narongsak Osatanakorn, head of the joint command center, said the mini-submarine would not have been practical.



Musk responded by saying Osatanakorn was “not the subject matter expert” and that he had been “inaccurately described as rescue chief” and should have been labeled the “former Thai provincial governor”. Osatanakorn stepped down as Chiang Rai governor during the rescue, but was still acting as commander.

Musk’s Sunday tweets came in response to a New York Times opinion piece entitled “What Elon Musk Should Learn From the Thailand Cave Rescue”. The Tesla CEO appears to be committed to proving his design would have worked. He wrote: “We will make [a video] of the mini-sub/pod going all the way to Cave 5 no problemo.”

He also responded to one critic who had called the submarine idea “absurd” a week earlier, writing: “Stay tuned jackass.” That tweet too was deleted.",https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/jul/15/elon-musk-british-diver-thai-cave-rescue-pedo-twitter
Electric vehicles mean first responders have to deal with battery fires,2018-07-03T16:30:31Z,"Last week, federal investigators reported that the battery of a Tesla Model S reignited twice after the car’s fiery crash in May. This isn’t the first time an electric vehicle battery has caught fire again after being put out. Why does this happen — and how are first responders being trained to deal with new risks from EV batteries?

The lithium-ion batteries in electric vehicles are basically the same as the ones in your phone, says Joshua Lamb, a principal investigator at Sandia National Laboratories’ Battery Abuse Testing Laboratory. There’s just more of them. Unfortunately, li-ion batteries are prone to exploding anyway when they get overheated or when the wrong charger or current is used.

“There’s always a risk when you’re talking about any kind of stored energy,” says Lamb. But that doesn’t mean EVs are inherently more dangerous; after all, there are plenty of gasoline car fires, too. “We just have 100 years of trial and error with gasoline fires that we don’t have with modern electric vehicles,” he adds. “The main issue is that we don’t necessarily have the same comfort level with the different failure modes.”

With batteries, even once you put the fire out, there’s stored energy inside

So what do first responders need to do differently when they encounter an EV fire?

The first step is identify the vehicle — not only that it’s an electric vehicle, but also the model so they know where the battery is and how to shut down the vehicle, says Michael Gorin. Gorin is program manager of emerging technologies at the National Fire Protection Association, a nonprofit that works with firefighters and first responders. Many EVs run silently, so there’s a risk that a firefighter won’t realize the vehicle is still on and will try to help the driver while they’re still in the car. Or the first responder who is unaware might get shocked by the voltage.

Reignition like the Tesla case is a problem, too. “With a gasoline fire, once you put the fire out, you take away the fuel,” says Lamb. “But with batteries, even once you put the fire out, there’s stored energy inside. You can have significant damage to a system without it being entirely discharged.” The undamaged cells of the battery can still get hot and discharge stored energy. Then, says Marca Doeff, a battery expert at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all you need is oxygen from the air and heat — maybe hidden smoldering embers, maybe from the battery’s own voltage — to reignite.

It takes at least 2,600 gallons of water to put out a battery fire, according to Gorin, and handling the battery or moving it can make it more prone to reigniting. (This is why the Tesla first responders guides suggest letting the batteries burn out.)

Accidents happen with even the most careful engineering

In truth, we still don’t have the data yet on the dangers of EVs versus regular cars. There’s a vehicle fire on a US roadway about every three minutes, Gorin says, but we don’t know how many of those are electric. But since the technology is so new, each accident merits a lot more attention and scrutiny. For what it’s worth, Tesla claims that — based on reports from their 300,000 vehicles on the road — its EV is 10 times less likely to catch fire than a gas car.

Of course, EV batteries are already engineered to protect against common causes of fire. Tesla’s batteries, for example, consist of cells divided into separate modules. These modules are each separated by a firewall to limit the risk of fire spreading, according to a company spokesperson. Plenty of researchers are trying to develop safer batteries with less flammable materials, Lamb says. But these chemical formulations don’t store as much energy, so they’re less likely to be commercialized. And accidents happen with even the most careful engineering.

For the past nine years, NFPA has run an EV safety training program for emergency responders and created guides for responding to fires in a vehicle that uses an alternative source of fuel, meaning electric cars, natural gas cars, and hybrids. They’ve worked with the US Department of Energy, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and other groups to travel around the country and train fire responders in person. Gorin estimates that, of the one million firefighters in the US, they’ve trained about 250,000. (A spokesperson for Tesla confirmed that its batteries comply with NFPA standards, and added that first responders can reach out to the company via a hotline.)",https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530646/tesla-battery-fire-electric-vehicles-transportation-science
Elon Musk and Grimes have broken up after 3 years together. Here's where their relationship began and everything that's happened since.,2019-12-28T05:01:43Z,"SpaceX and Tesla CEO Elon Musk and the musician Grimes started dating in 2018.

Since then, they've broken up and reunited a few times. Now, they appear to just be co-parents.

Here's a timeline of their relationship, including a move to Texas and the birth of three kids.

Billionaire and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been divorced three times, dated celebrities, and has 10 known children. Musk and Canadian musician Grimes have three children together. Here's a look at their relationship.

Claire Boucher, better known by her stage name Grimes, is a Canadian singer and producer. She's also an outspoken advocate for female artists and their treatment by the press and music industry. She's released multiple albums to critical acclaim, and her breakout album, ""Visions,"" won the Juno Award for Electronic Album of the Year.

Grimes and Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, met over Twitter. Musk was planning to make a joke about artificial intelligence and discovered she had beaten him to the punch via the Rococo Basilisk character from her ""Flesh Without Blood"" music video.

In May 2018, shortly before the annual Costume Institute Gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, it was reported the pair had been ""quietly dating"" for a few weeks, the couple planned to attend the Met Gala together.

They had been tweeting at each other for a few months, starting around the same time Musk and actress Amber Heard broke up.

Grimes and Musk did end up attending the Met Gala together, which was their first official appearance as a couple. Musk later said he loves Grimes for her ""wild fae artistic creativity and hyper intense work ethic.""

News of their relationship spurred an outpouring of memes by their legions of loyal fans online, who were caught by surprise by the unexpected pairing. Someone even made a Google Chrome extension that replaced all instances of ""Elon Musk"" on a webpage with ""Grimes' Boyfriend.""

Early on in their relationship, Grimes took to Twitter several times to defend Musk and Tesla. In since-deleted tweets, Grimes said Musk has never tried to stop Tesla workers from unionizing and claimed she encouraged a union vote among Tesla employees.

Grimes also began attending official events with Musk, like the Hyperloop Pod Competition in July 2018. She and Musk, along with his five sons, made an unscheduled appearance at the event.

That same month, after it was revealed that Musk had made donations to Republican political committees, Grimes defended his choice, calling it ""the price of doing business."" After her tweets began to receive some backlash, she added that ""there is no world in which i'm ok w republican donations.""

That August, Musk sent this now infamous tweet: ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" He later admitted he picked the $420 share price as a joke to amuse Grimes, according to the SEC.

Musk and Tesla eventually settled with the SEC over the tweet, agreeing to pay $20 million apiece. Musk also agreed to step down as chairman of Tesla's board and appoint a committee to oversee his communications.

Rapper Azealia Banks claimed to be at Musk's house in Los Angeles during that weekend while he was ""scrounging for investors"" following his tweet. She compared the situation to something out of the movie ""Get Out.""

Later that summer, Musk and Grimes unfollowed each other on Instagram, and Musk unfollowed Grimes on Twitter, which caused some to speculate that their relationship was on the rocks.

But by October, it appeared that they had reconnected: they were spotted at a pumpkin patch in Los Angeles with Musk's five sons. Musk also re-followed Grimes on Twitter.

A few months later, in January 2019, Grimes tweeted that she was ""randomly"" in China at the same time as Musk was opening Tesla's new factory in Shanghai. The two were filmed eating a meal together in Beijing.

In November 2019, hologram Grimes may have made an appearance at the unveiling of Tesla's highly anticipated Cybertruck — the ""cybergirl"" hologram who unveiled the truck sported a seemingly identical leg tattoo to the one Grimes has. Many speculated the hologram was actually Grimes, although it was never confirmed.

Tesla

A few weeks later, the couple was spotted cruising around Los Angeles in the Cybertruck, stopping to grab dinner at high-end Japanese restaurant Nobu.

When Grimes performed at the 2019 Game Awards in December, Musk was in the audience, even giving her a standing ovation.

The couple stopped by the annual Kardashian-Jenner family Christmas Eve party that December, posing for a photo with Kim Kardashian, Kanye West, and rappers Travis Scott, Quavo, and Saweetie.

Then, in January, Grimes dropped a bombshell: she posted a nude photo to her Instagram and Twitter accounts that showed her pregnant with a fetus Photoshopped on her belly. The post didn't include a caption, but in a comment on the post, Grimes appeared to imply that she was, in fact, pregnant.

Grimes later confirmed that she was expecting a baby. She said in February 2020 that the internet had already guessed some of the names she was considering for her child.

During a livestream on Twitch in February to promote her new album, ""Miss Anthropocene,"" Grimes revealed the baby's due date was May 4. Days before Grimes' due date, Musk acknowledged the pregnancy on Twitter.

On the evening of May 4, Musk announced on Twitter that the baby was born, saying ""Mom & baby all good."" In follow-up tweets, Musk wrote that the couple had a baby boy. One Twitter user asked Musk the name of their child, to which he responded, ""X Æ A-12 Musk.""

The couple later amended the baby's name to ""X Æ A-Xii"" due to California naming laws, but they appear to call him, simply, ""X.""

In late 2020, Musk announced that he had moved to Texas over a spat with the state of California over coronavirus lockdowns. The couple was spotted hanging out in Austin, and Grimes also confirmed that she had moved to the Texas capital.

In March 2021, Musk posted a rare family photo of him, Grimes, and baby X with the caption ""Starbase, Texas,"" a reference to the city he hopes to create around SpaceX's launch facilities.

When Musk hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" in May of 2021, Grimes made a cameo, appearing as Princess Peach in a Super Mario-themed sketch.

But the move to Texas appeared to put a strain on Musk and Grimes' relationship. In September 2021, Musk said he and Grimes were ""semi-separated"" but still loved each other and were on great terms.

""It's mostly that my work at SpaceX and Tesla requires me to be primarily in Texas or traveling overseas, and her work is primarily in LA,"" he said at the time.

He added that Grimes is ""staying with me now and Baby X is in the adjacent room."" Soon after, Grimes posted a video on TikTok of her trying to get X to say ""mama"" — Musk's voice was audible in the background.

In March 2022, Grimes revealed a major secret: she and Musk had had another child together via surrogate, a baby girl named Exa Dark Sideræl Musk, called Y for short. The baby's existence was discovered by a Vanity Fair reporter who visited Grimes at home and heard a baby crying upstairs.

""I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid,"" Grimes said of dating Musk. ""We live in separate houses. We're best friends. We see each other all the time.""

She also said she planned to have one or two more children with Musk. But after the interview was published, Grimes said she and Musk had already broken up again.

Since then, Grimes reportedly dated whistle-blower Chelsea Manning, while Musk was spotted with Australian actress Natasha Bassett. And in July, Business Insider reported that Musk had secretly fathered twins with Shivon Zilis, one of his top executives at Neuralink, born weeks before his daughter with Grimes.

In March 2023, Grimes said she changed her daughter's name with Elon Musk to a symbol but that the government won't officially acknowledge it.

In September 2023, a new biography of Elon Musk confirmed that he had a previously unreported third child with Grimes. The child is named Techno Mechanicus, per the biography.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-girlfriend-grimes-relationship-photos-2018-8
"Tesla’s holiday software update includes voice-to-text, and a song making kit",2019-12-25T16:30:00Z,"Tesla has started rolling out a massive holiday update that was previously teased by CEO Elon Musk last week, including a “Full Self-Driving sneak preview.” It also includes long-awaited features like reading text messages aloud, a “camping mode,” and more.

The “full self-driving” sneak preview is mainly an improvement on the driving visualizations that appear in-car. The new visualization can now “display additional objects that include stoplights, stop signs, and select road markings.” The update notes, however, that stop signs and stoplight visualizations “are not a substitute for an attentive driver and will not stop the car.” Here’s the visualization in action:

One of the biggest feature updates allows driver to listen to and send messages via Tesla’s built-in voice commands. What seems like a basic ability for any modern car was previously unavailable. Tesla doesn’t use other third-party services like Apple Carplay or Android Auto, according to Tesla news site Electrek, but customers have requested the feature for years.

Tesla’s update notes specify customers can “now read and respond to text messages using your right scroll wheel button.” When drivers receive a new text message, all they have to do is “press the right scroll wheel button to have your text message read out loud and press again to respond by speaking out loud.” Customers will also be able to view messages via the “Cards” section on the touchscreen. The feature won’t work with group texts, and notifications on phones must be enabled.

Another long requested feature, going back to the Model S launch in 2012, is the release of Camp Mode. The update will allow customers who want to use their vehicles for camping situations to “maintain airflow, temperature, interior lighting, as well as play music, and power devices when Camp Mode is enabled.” Although Tesla issued a software update in 2017 that allowed for climate control features to run for an extended length of time, this new update marks the first official Camp Mode. Its arrival comes just one month after Musk revealed Tesla’s new vehicle, the Cybertruck. A camper configuration will be available to purchase, making the mode somewhat essential.

Of course, a Tesla update wouldn’t be complete without a few fun additions. There are a couple of new games available to play on the center console, but the more exciting addition is TRAX. TRAX is a digital audio workstation, similar to Apple’s Garage Band that’s available on MacBook and Mac devices. Once in park, customers have the ability to mess around and make their own songs on the fly.

Elon Musk explains why Tesla’s Cybertruck windows smashed during presentation,2019-11-25T11:00:44Z,"is a senior reporter who has covered AI, robotics, and more for eight years at The Verge.

The unveiling of Tesla’s Cybertruck last week was full of surprises, but none more shocking than the moment when lead designer Franz von Holzhausen smashed two of the vehicle’s “armor glass” windows onstage with a metal ball. It certainly wasn’t the result CEO Elon Musk was expecting, who could be heard muttering “oh my fucking god” under his breath before being forced to complete his presentation in front of the fractured panes.

But Musk says he knows what went wrong, and explained things on Twitter. Right before the metal ball test, von Holzhausen smacked the door with a sledgehammer on stage to prove its durability (and unlike the glass, it was fine), and Musk says this impact “cracked base of glass,” which is why the windows subsequently smashed when hit by the ball.

The moment the first window of the Cybertruck was smashed.

This seems plausible, especially as Musk also shared a slow motion video of von Holzhausen performing the same exact test before the event, with the ball bouncing harmlessly off the window. The combined impacts likely weakened the glass, setting the stage for the eventual smash. (Though why the back window broke as well isn’t clear: the passenger door didn’t get whomped by the sledgehammer.)

At any rate, the smashed glass was just one moment in an event which gave viewers plenty to talk about without the on-stage mishaps. The divisive design and impressive specs of the Cybertruck have caught the world’s attention, and since the unveiling Musk has been drip-feeding bits of information on Twitter to keep people engaged.

Solar panels on the roof that charge the car as it drives? We’re doing it, says Musk. A new matte black finish? “Sure,” he says. The Tesla CEO even suggested a second, “smaller” version of the Cybertruck would make sense in the “long term.”",https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/25/20981489/tesla-cybertruck-glass-window-fail-elon-musk-explanation
Tesla made an ATV to complement its futuristic Cybertruck,2019-11-22T04:39:48Z,"is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

At the Tesla Cybertruck event in Los Angeles on Thursday, Elon Musk said three words most of the tech world is familiar with: “One more thing.” That turned out to be an electric all-terrain vehicle. The ATV can charge from the bed of the Cybertruck, naturally.

The Tesla ATV’s aesthetic is still very much in the Blade Runner motif that Musk touted in the run-up to the event. We’ll have more details about the ATV as we get them from Tesla, so stay tuned.

Update November 22nd, 3:56PM ET: Over 12 hours after the event, Tesla has yet to release any specs related to the ATV. But we do have a few more details.

First, the ATV is called the Tesla Cyberquad. Second, Musk tweeted earlier today that it will be first be made available as an option with the Cybertruck. So that means it won’t be sold as a stand-alone vehicle — at least not initially. The CEO also confirmed that the ATV will be a two-seater.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20977300/tesla-atv-electric-features-range-price-release-date-announcement-elon-musk-all-terrain
Tesla Cybertruck: Elon Musk announces electric pickup truck,2019-11-22T04:21:47Z,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk just unveiled the company’s first electric pickup truck, also known as Cybertruck, at an event in Los Angeles, California. The truck will come in three versions with 250 miles, 300 miles, and 500 miles of range, respectively. And it will start at $39,900, Musk said. The truck won’t be rolling off the assembly line until late 2021, but preorders can be made at tesla.com/cybertruck.

Always a showman, Musk put the truck through its paces in an effort to demonstrate its ruggedness. He had Franz von Holzhausen, Tesla’s chief of design, hit the door of the truck with a sledgehammer several times, claimed it was practically bulletproof, and showed the truck winning a tug-of-war with a Ford F150 and a drag race with a Porsche 911.

However, when he tried to show how shatterproof the “armored” glass was, things went awry. A metal ball thrown by von Holzhausen shattered both the truck’s windows. “We’ll fix it in post,” a sheepish Musk quipped.

There are three versions of the truck available:

Single motor rear-wheel drive with 250 miles of range, 7,500-pound towing capacity, and 0–60 mph capabilities in under 6.5 seconds, for $39,900

Dual motor all-wheel drive with 300 miles of range, 10,000-pound towing capacity, and 0–60 mph in under 4.5 seconds for $49,900

Triple motor all-wheel drive with 500 miles of range, 14,000-pound towing capacity, and 0–60 mph in under 2.9 seconds for $69,900 (though this version won’t start production until late 2022)

The truck can seat a total of six adults, Tesla says. The body is made of ultra-hard 30X cold-rolled stainless steel. Musk had von Holzhausen demonstrate the body’s strength by smashing it with the aforementioned sledgehammer. The payload has a 3,500-pound capacity, with 100 cubic feet of storage space. The truck’s vault length is 6.5 feet, and it will have 4-inch suspension in either direction. A 17-inch touchscreen sits in the center of the dashboard, though images of the interior look slightly unfinished. (Is that dashboard made of Formica?)

Musk has spent the better part of a decade poking at the idea of a Tesla pickup truck. He tweeted in 2012 that he “[w]ould love to make a Tesla supertruck” with “crazy torque” and “dynamic air suspension.” By 2013, he told Business Insider that the company was actually planning to make one. The pickup was even featured in his second “master plan” for Tesla, which he published in 2016.

Musk continued to toy with the idea in public, saying in April 2017 that a reveal event would happen in “18 to 24 months.” In 2018 he said the truck had taken on a “futuristic-like cyberpunk, Blade Runner” design, and that he didn’t even care much if people didn’t like it. He’s since said the pickup truck is his favorite project out of all the ones Tesla’s working on.

While the pickup truck has obviously been a pet project for Musk, it could also be a great opportunity for Tesla’s business. Not only are pickup sales on the rise in the US, but trucks command high average selling prices and high profit margins.

“Pickup truck buyers spend a lot on their trucks,” says Tyson Jominy, vice president of data and analytics consulting at JD Power. “A $50,000 pickup truck is a very common occurrence now. People are willing to spend on this segment to haul their toys, to support a lifestyle.”

Tesla’s business could arguably use the bump. While the company squeaked out a $143 million profit in the past quarter, it only did so after including $164 million worth of regulatory credits and money that it’s banked from customers who’ve paid for the yet-to-be-released “full self-driving” version of Autopilot.

That said, a lot will happen between now and when the truck starts shipping. Not only will Tesla soon start producing Model 3s in China for that market, making it less of a burden to sell cars there, but the company is also releasing the Model Y crossover at the end of 2020.

One of the only segments rivaling the growth of pickup trucks over the last few years is the SUV segment (and especially the small SUV segment). If things go according to plan for Tesla, the company’s business will already be in better shape by the time the Cybertruck ships, meaning whatever profit it can reap from the pickup will be gravy.

Tesla has led the charge into long-range electric vehicles, and there’s currently no mass-market electric pickup truck available for sale. But the landscape will change by the time the truck ships. Ford has an all-electric F-150 on the way, General Motors confirmed it will put an electric pickup on the market in 2021, and EV startup Rivian — which is now backed by both Ford and Amazon — is scheduled to release its electric pickup in late 2020.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date

Pickups have become more popular lately — their share of the US light vehicle market increased to 17.5 percent in 2019, from just under 13 percent in 2012. They’re also the fastest-growing auto segment in the US. That makes Tesla’s entry into pickups sensible, analysts say. Another pickup perk: pricing. Pickups tend to be expensive.

Even with direct competition from established players (like Ford’s forthcoming electric F-150) and newcomers (like Rivian), there is a ton of money to be made in pickup trucks.",https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975980/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-news-pickup-truck-elon-musk-updates-highlights

Read more about how Tesla’s self-driving feature will work.

Tesla

Tesla has an ambitious timeline to roll out its full self-driving Tesla. During the company’s most recent earnings call, Musk claimed that an improved version of Smart Summon would launch in the coming weeks. This would be followed by a feature-complete Autopilot by the end of 2019 at the earliest, meaning the car would be able to handle intermediate-speed driving situations. This is in addition to Smart Summon, which handles low-speed driving and highway-based Autopilot that covers higher speeds. Musk also claims that Tesla’s Uber-like robo-taxi service could still reach a feature-complete state as early as next year. Read more.

Other things we learned from the call:

The Tesla Model Y will start deliveries in summer 2020.

Musk thinks the Tesla Pickup Truck could be the company’s “best product ever.”

Musk considers the Model S and X as “niche…expensive” products that are still in production mostly for “sentimental” reasons.

The Model S, X, and 3 are set to receive a software update that brings five percent power boosts, faster supercharging, and single-pedal driving that will improve the range.

But could Tesla lose its crown as the number one electric car seller? UBS autos analyst Patrick Hummel claimed this week that Volkswagen could claim the top spot by 2025, as the company plans to produce 1 million electric cars by 2022. Volkswagen, which was at the center of an emissions cheating scandal just four years ago, is planning to spend $33.24 billion to move further into e-mobility by 2023. Read more.

Tesla solar

Tesla unleashed its third-generation solar tiles over the weekend. The new tiles, debuting after extensive tests, are larger, redesigned, easier to install, and it’s now harder to spot the solar elements. The company is planning to work with third-party roof installers to offer eight-hour install times — a marked difference from the electric car aspect of the business, where Tesla does not work with third-party dealerships.

The tiles are also expected to be cheaper. Independent analysis from Electrek showed that a 9.45-kilowatt roof measuring 1,862 square feet would have costed $64,634 under the second-generation pricing but has now dropped to $38,266. Once the Powerwall battery and repairs are factored in, the price difference is $85,000 for the old roof and $54,866 for the new model. Musk claims the new prices undercut the cost of a new roof plus solar.

Will it be enough? Tesla is expected to install them everywhere it offers the solar retrofit tiles instead of the small-scale approach employed since last spring. But the company is also advising consumers that buying the solar roof might not be right for them, especially if they have no need to replace their roof. Whether it will see widespread adoption or not, the solar roof remains one of Tesla’s most intriguing products. Read more.

What’s next for Tesla: Tesla is expected to roll out a software update in the coming weeks for the Model S, X, and 3 that will bring single-pedal driving for greater range, faster supercharging, and five percent greater power.

“It’s been over 15 years since a Swedish company introduced an automatic fueling system for city buses with no attendant necessary. The fueling point on the bus had only to get within about a half meter and a sensor brought the filler nozzle to and into the tank with sensors sensing full. Seems to me electric would be easier.”

You may be thinking of the Tankomatic system, covered in a New Scientist article from 1990. The robot, created by a firm called Transrobot near Stockholm, automatically inserted the nozzle into the gas tank for the driver. The firm also developed a modified version for buses.

Electric may perhaps be easier. Tesla previously demonstrated a robotic charging arm for the Model S. As well as enabling autonomous cars to complete their journey without any humans, it would also help protect users who want to disconnect and drive away without leaving their car.

Tankomatic used airtight seals to keep in the vapors and would stop if anyone tried to tamper mid-pump. With electric, neither of these would be such pressing concerns.

Tesla’s Smart Summon parking feature has been used over a million times,2019-10-23T21:47:20Z,"is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

Smart Summon, the autonomous parking feature rolled out by Tesla in mid-September, has already been used “over one million times,” the company said in its quarterly earnings statement Wednesday.

The feature enables a Tesla vehicle to leave a parking space and navigate around obstacles to its owner. Tesla owners who purchased the Full Self-Driving option on their car received it as part of the version 10 software update that went out on September 26th. Using just the Tesla app on your smartphone, you can “summon” your car to you from a maximum distance of 200 feet, as long as the car is within your line of sight.

There were some hiccups, though

There were some hiccups, though, with some users posting videos on Twitter and YouTube of near crashes or confused, slow-moving vehicles. One Tesla owner tweeted about “front bumper damage,” while another claimed their Model 3 “ran into the side of [a] garage.” A video of a near collision with a speeding SUV left the owner feeling their test of Smart Summon “didn’t go so well.” Another Tesla was filmed seemingly confused by pedestrians and other cars as it tried to make its way across a Walmart parking lot.

But the company says it expects to roll out over-the-air software updates in the future that may address some of these snags.

Tesla

Electric cars may have already reached a tipping point, Elon Musk’s comments revealed this week. The Tesla CEO noted that an internal combustion vehicle purchased today would probably lack resale value in the long term. Musk’s comments coincide with research from Capital One, which found that the launch of the Tesla Model 3 led to a slew of luxury European vehicles hitting the used market while demand remained steady, causing a drop in prices. Electrek editor Fred Lambert told Inverse in July that the market would likely reach a tipping point by 2025, where it would make zero economic sense to purchase a traditional vehicle. Deloitte argued in January that the overall costs for an electric vehicle could overtake a traditional car as early as 2022. Read more.

“Smart Summon” has become a viral hit. The feature, which rolled out in the Version 10.1 software update, allows users to autonomously move their car while they maintain line of sight.

What if you’re Supercharging late night alone and someone threatens you? Tesla is a high end target. I’m female. I’d like to disconnect from supercharger from inside Tesla and get out of there. Any chance of that?

Assuming the technology is feasible, this is an idea that could definitely help people escape from threatening situations. It could also benefit electric car owners sharing charge points. Electric vehicle etiquette suggests car owners should unplug as soon as possible to avoid holding a space for too long.

Perhaps Tesla could revive its prototype robotic Supercharger arm, which could offer more benefits than just charging autonomous cars without human intervention.

Terry Knight writes

I remember as a kid watching a film where a GM concept car from the 50s or 60s used electrical Power similar to a trolley car but the cables where embedded in the road. Why couldn’t some express ways be sit up where electric cars could be charged up on the go? As the car travels over the charging road the operator would have the option to take a charge or not! The vehicles could have a transponder or toll pass device onboard to activate and pay for the amount of charge it uses. The patches of roads could be sit up where both Tesla trucks and cars could take a charge on the go.

A similar concept has been tested in recent years. Stockholm debuted a 1.2-mile stretch of electric rail, transferred via an arm attached to the underside of the car. Inverse covered in March a new wireless charging system for taxis in Oslo, which can align with the coils at a taxi rank while they wait for customers.

Musk is perhaps unlikely to take advice from GM about electric cars, though, as he cites the film Who Killed the Electric Car? as part of his inspiration to get into the business.

Meet the Chinese vaccine billionaire whose net worth skyrocketed even more than Elon Musk's in 2020,2020-12-31T22:20:00Z,"Elon Musk's net worth soared by $139 billion this year thanks to Tesla's stock surge.

Though Musk gained the most in sheer billions by nearly quintupling his fortune, little-known Chinese billionaire Zhong Shanshan's net worth skyrocketed by more than 1,000%.

Zhong is now worth $77.8 billion, up from $6.9 billion at the beginning of 2020, making him Asia's richest person.

He is chairman at bottled water company Nongfu Spring, invested in a Covid-19 vaccine that is currently in clinical trials.

Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.

For most of the world's richest people, 2020 was a good year for their finances. The collective net worth of America's billionaires now tops $4 trillion, rising by 36% from March 18 to December 18 according to a report by Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute of Policy Studies.

The biggest gainer by far is Elon Musk, who is now worth $167 billion, up from $28 billion at the start of the year, per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. He owns about 18% of Tesla's stock, which has increased by more than 700% in 2020, and entered the S&P 500 on December 21. Musk also unlocked four tranches of his historic stock compensation package this year. That's a 496% increase for Mr. Musk.

But a press-shy Chinese tycoon has seen even greater growth: Zhong Shanshan.

Little-known Chinese billionaire Zhong Shanshan's net worth increased 1,000% in 2020, beating Elon Musk's fivefold increase.

The 66-year-old Zhong, nicknamed the ""Lone Wolf"" by the media, is the chairman of Nongfu Spring and took the Chinese bottled-water giant public in September. The IPO made him China's third-richest person in less than a day.

Zhong is now worth an estimated $77.8 billion, a 1,000% jump in the past 12 months, largely thanks to his 87% stake in Nongfu Spring. Nongfu Spring is China's top bottled water supplier and is known for its distinctive red bottle caps. The Hangzhou-based company recorded 11.545 billion RMB ($1.8 billion) of revenue in the first half of 2020.

Zhong's two sisters and three of his wife's relatives have minority stakes in Nongfu Spring, according to the prospectus released in August ahead of the IPO. His son, Shu Zi, who was 32 years old at the time of the prospectus's publication, is a non-executive director and member of the audit committee. He graduated from the University of California, Irvine in 2011 with a bachelor's degree in English.

The bottled water tycoon has become Asia's richest person during China's clampdown on big tech.

Zhong has usurped Indian oil and gas tycoon Mukesh Ambani as Asia's richest person and is now the 11th-richest person in the world, just behind Oracle's Larry Ellison. He well surpasses Tencent's Pony Ma, worth an estimated $56 billion, making Zhong the wealthiest person in China.

Pony Ma became the country's richest person in June after unseating Alibaba's Jack Ma. (The two men are not related). Jack Ma was well-placed to regain the top spot until the IPO of Ant Group, a payments company majority-owned by Ma, was halted by Chinese regulators. His net worth has plummeted by $12 billion in the past two months and currently sits at $51.2 billion.

Zhong is also an investor in a Chinese vaccine for Covid-19 in development.

Zhong has a 75% stake in Beijing Wantai Pharmacy Enterprise, which manufacturers vaccine and hepatitis test kits. He founded the 1,000-employee firm in 1993 and currently serves as chairman. Wantai went public this past April and stock has since risen by almost 1,500%.

The manufacturer has turned its attention to Covid-19, developing three antibody and one PCR test. It has delivered more than 7 million Covid-19 serology tests as of August 28. Wantai, according to Reuters, is starting a mid-stage clinical trial of a nasal spray coronavirus vaccine in China.

If this vaccine is successful, Zhong stands to enter the ranks of the 10 richest people in the world — or higher. Several executives and scientists behind approved vaccines have become billionaires this year, such as Dr. Uğur Şahin of BioNTech and Moderna's Stéphane Bancel.

Though Zhong's net worth has skyrocketed in 2020, his career is not an overnight success story. Nongfu Spring and Wantai are far from Zhong's first business ventures. He dropped out of elementary school when he was 12 when his parents were targeted during the Cultural Revolution, according to the Financial Times. Sun Yu and Judith Evans report that Zhong tried his hand at construction, newspaper reporting, and selling erectile dysfunction pills with little success before founding the two companies that constitute his wealth.",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/elon-musk-zhong-shanshan-billionaires-net-worth-comparison-1029927839
German automakers are charged up and ready to take a run at Tesla,2020-12-31T22:09:26Z,"Open this photo in gallery: A Porsche Taycan Turbo S sits parked at a charge station.manuel hollenbach/Supplied

The Porsche Taycan rocketed from a standstill so fast that my skull banged against the headrest and my vision went blurry.

It was a demonstration of what can happen when German engineers apply their brainpower to electric cars. And it offered a clue to how German luxury-car makers hope to prevent Tesla Inc. from destroying the country’s most important export industry.

A year after Porsche brought the Taycan to market, Mercedes-Benz and Audi are on the verge of rolling out their first luxury cars designed from scratch to run on batteries, rather than simply being awkward conversions of gasoline models.

These new purebred electric models will determine whether German automakers can retain their hegemony in the high end of the market in the face of an onslaught from Tesla, which is encroaching on their turf – literally – by planting a factory in a forest near Berlin. German engineering is confronting Silicon Valley audacity head-on, with the future of the German economy at stake.

Tesla also has a lot at stake. The company’s US$658-billion stock market value makes sense only if investors believe the company will one day eclipse traditional car makers in sales and render the likes of Daimler AG and Volkswagen AG irrelevant.

The Taycan, a four-door sedan that Porsche recently let me try out at the Hockenheimring racing complex south of Heidelberg, provides an early example of what German automakers are capable of. The car, with a starting price of slightly more than US$100,000, can blast from zero to 60 mph (97 km/h) in less than three seconds.

So, it happens, can the Tesla S. But tests by Car and Driver confirm Porsche’s assertion that the Taycan can replicate those blastoffs 10 times in a row, unlike the Tesla, which becomes sluggish with repeat use as the battery wears down. Porsche has found a way to maintain explosive acceleration even when the battery is not fully charged.

During an hour of all-out driving on Porsche’s serpentine test track, as I was egged on by a Porsche instructor who encouraged me to probe the car’s limits, the Taycan stayed glued to the asphalt like a roadster and never showed signs of fatigue. I ran out of juice before the car did.

“Our plan from the beginning was that our electric vehicle should be a real Porsche,” Stefan Weckbach, the Porsche executive in charge of the Taycan, told reporters in 2020.

That pretty much sums up the approach that the German luxury-car makers, after a belated start, are taking to electric cars. Germany is considered the birthplace of the gasoline-powered automobile, and it remains a source of national pride. Its automakers want to show that they can adapt their expertise in high performance, reliability and comfort to electric vehicles.

“We will score points with our classic qualities,” Markus Duesmann, CEO of Audi, said in an interview.

The pandemic has only increased the pressure on traditional automakers to offer true electric vehicles. Sales of gasoline and diesel cars in Europe have plunged since the virus hit, but sales of electric vehicles have more than doubled, largely because of government incentives.

In November, one out of 11 new cars registered in Western Europe was electric, a record, according to Matthias Schmidt, an analyst in Berlin who publishes a monthly report on the electric-car market.

The Germans have decades of experience creating cocoon-like interiors, sinewy suspensions and exteriors dressed in precisely fitted steel. Tesla, founded in 2003, has struggled with quality and manufacturing problems, although it has proved to be a fast learner.

When it comes to electric cars, the Germans lag Tesla. The Taycan cannot go as far on a charge as the Tesla Model S and lacks Tesla’s self-driving software, two features that may be more important to many buyers than drag-strip performance. The German manufacturers are trying to close that technology gap and, they hope, overtake Tesla before it’s too late.

The first manifestations of their efforts are about to hit showrooms.

Audi, which, like Porsche, is a part of the Volkswagen AG empire, began production in December of the battery-powered e-tron GT, which will cost more than US$100,000 when it goes on sale in March. It shares many components with the Taycan, but its emphasis is on driving comfort rather than setting speed records.

Later in 2022, Audi plans to begin selling the Q4, a compact electric SUV that will be the division’s first model based on the so-called modular electronic toolbox, a collection of components designed specifically for battery-powered cars that will be shared among Volkswagen brands. The toolbox allows auto designers to make the interiors of electric cars roomier than those of gasoline cars by arraying the batteries and motors in ways not possible with internal combustion engines. Tesla already applies that principle to its interiors, which are known for their spaciousness and lack of clutter.

Car makers have been using these collections of shared components, often called platforms, for years, but Volkswagen is one of the first mass-market automakers to develop one specifically for battery power. By building hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of cars using the same components, Volkswagen, the world’s largest car maker, hopes to do what it does best: drive down the cost per vehicle with massive production volumes, and beat Tesla on price.

The strategy is helping to hold down the cost of the Audi Q4, which will start around US$49,000, in Germany. That is competitive with comparable gasoline cars and in the same general price range as Tesla’s base car, the Model 3.

In 2021, Mercedes, a division of Daimler AG, will introduce the EQS, a battery-powered counterpart to the company’s top-of-the-line S-Class. The EQS, which will cost more than US$100,000, will be the first vehicle built with Mercedes’s “electric-vehicle architecture,” the same idea as Volkswagen’s modular toolbox.

Daimler says the EQS will be able to travel 700 kilometres on a charge. That would be slightly more than the current Tesla S. In 2022, Daimler will introduce additional models based on the electric-vehicle platform, including a battery-powered SUV, to be produced at the company’s U.S. factory in Tuscaloosa, Ala.

BMW Group has been slower than its rivals to offer luxury electric vehicles. The company was a pioneer with the battery-powered i3 compact in 2014, but it didn’t catch on with buyers. BMW does not plan to begin producing its own pure electric platform until 2025, instead offering electrified versions of its conventional models.

Pieter Nota, head of marketing at BMW, told reporters in November that the company does not expect sales of electric vehicles to take off until 2025.

“That’s why we are starting our battery-centric platform by then,” he said.

After stealing significant market share from vehicles such as the BMW 3 Series and the Mercedes C-Class, Tesla has been showing some vulnerability. Sales in Europe of the Model 3 have been basically flat in recent months after it decisively outsold the European automakers last year. The Renault Zoe, a utilitarian compact designed for urban use, overtook the Model 3 to become the best selling battery-powered car in Europe during the first 10 months of 2020.

Volkswagen is trying to undercut Tesla’s lead in battery technology. The company invested US$300-million in QuantumScape, a Silicon Valley firm that is developing solid-state batteries. If the new type of battery can be perfected and mass produced, it will cost less, charge faster and go further than current technology.

“If they succeed in bringing this technology to market sooner than Tesla, then Elon Musk has a problem,” said Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, director of the Center Automotive Research in Duisburg, Germany.

Mr. Musk, Tesla’s CEO, will strengthen his foothold in Europe when his new factory in Gruenheide, east of Berlin, begins producing cars in 2021.

The factory, which Tesla announced in November, 2019, hit a snag recently when environmental groups won a court order blocking Tesla from clearing trees on a portion of the site. The groups argued that the construction work threatened an endangered species of sand lizard.

But Tesla has strong support from local political leaders thrilled at the prospect of 10,000 new jobs and the presence of a company that is worth far more on the stock market than all of the German automakers combined.

The main factory building in Gruenheide, on a site already approved, appears to be complete. Mr. Musk, who frequently flies in for quick visits, said he sometimes spent the night in a conference room at the factory because “it gives me a good feel for what’s going on.”

“I’m a big fan of Germany,” Mr. Musk said while in Berlin in December to pick up an award from Axel Springer, which publishes the country’s biggest newspaper. “I’ll be spending a lot of time there.”

Here are the top performing stocks in the S&P 500 for 2020,2020-12-31T21:31:37Z,"Some of the names in the broad market index had particularly strong years, with six stocks gaining more than 100%.

The S&P 500 finished 2020 with a gain of 16.26% for the year and closed at a record high on Thursday, a remarkable performance after a drastic selloff in February and March.

The S&P 500's climb would have been even more dramatic if the top two names on the list had started the year in the index. Both electric vehicle maker Tesla and e-commerce company Etsy were added to the S&P 500 during the final four months of the year.

Those stocks also represent two of the major themes in the market this year, as stocks tied to green energy had strong years, as did those like Etsy that were well-equipped for a stay-at-home world.

The top-eight performers also includes two semiconductor stocks in Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices . It was a strong year for the sector broadly, with the PHLX Semiconductor Index rising 51%, outpacing even the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite .

The S&P 500 is a market-weighted group of large cap stocks in the U.S. and is the benchmark that many professional investors measure themselves against. Many popular exchange traded funds and mutual are compared to the S&P 500, with more than $11 trillion tied to or benchmarked against the index as of December 2019, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.

Tech's top seven companies added $3.4 trillion in value in 2020,2020-12-31T21:29:13Z,"Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX and chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., arrives at the Axel Springer Award ceremony in Berlin, Germany, on Tuesday, Dec. 1, 2020.

Tech's biggest companies just wrapped up a huge year.

The seven most valuable U.S. technology companies — Apple , Microsoft , Amazon , Alphabet , Facebook , Tesla and Nvidia — picked up a combined $3.4 trillion in market cap in 2020, powering through a global pandemic and broader economic crisis.

Between continued optimism over iPhone sales, Microsoft's growing Teams collaboration product, Amazon's ongoing control of e-commerce and the strength of Google and Facebook's online ad duopoly, Big Tech was neither slowed by Covid-19 nor the rising number of investigations into its dominance.

Tesla's wild rally served as the biggest surprise.

The stock climbed almost ninefold this year, lifting the electric car maker's market cap from $76 billion at the beginning of the year to $669 billion at Thursday's close. Despite initial factory closures due to the pandemic, Tesla bounced back to deliver a record number of vehicles in the third quarter.",https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/31/techs-top-seven-companies-added-3point4-trillion-in-value-in-2020.html

Tesla sweetens new EV purchase with Full Self-Driving trial tossed in for free,2020-12-31T19:16:00Z,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk is out here making marketing moves on Twitter as we head into the final few days of 2020. Tuesday evening, Musk tweeted that anyone who purchases a new Tesla will receive three months of the company's Full Self-Driving mode free of charge. Access to the software, which remains in beta and not complete, typically costs $10,000 extra just to experience it.

All new Teslas come with a form of the firm's Autopilot system, a Level 2 partially automated technology on the SAE's scale of autonomy, but Full Self-Driving hopes to one day live up to its name. The company rolled out the technology to limited groups of drivers earlier this year and plans expand the invites to those who paid for the option to take advantage of the features. Even Tesla says the system may do the wrong thing at the wrong time, so it's definitely not ready for hands-free driving, but many owners found it works well with lots of supervision.

To take advantage of Musk's latest flash deal, buyers need to complete all documents and take delivery by Dec. 31 at midnight, so it's probably best to shop Teslas currently in stock if you really want the Full Self-Driving freebie. We also heard earlier this month Tesla authorized its staff to toss in free Supercharging once again for anyone purchasing a new EV as the automaker pushes for record deliveries in 2020.

We won't know if the tactics worked until early next year, but Musk is sort of the master of spurring fans to purchase when it counts.",https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/tesla-ev-full-self-driving-free-elon-musk/
Elon Musk sells trio of Bel-Air homes for $41 million,2020-12-31T18:24:27Z,"A skyrocketing net worth hasn’t stopped Elon Musk from pursuing his quest to “own no house.”

The Tesla CEO offloaded three adjacent Los Angeles homes to the tune of $40.9 million, the Los Angeles Times reports, bringing the total number of homes he has sold in 2020 to five.

The largest of the homes — a six bedroom, seven bathroom mansion clocking in at 9,300 square feet — sold for $29.7 million, while the others sold for $6.8 million and $4.4 million each, according to the report.

Musk, who has added $140 billion to his net worth over the past 12 months and is now the second richest man on earth with his $167 billion fortune, pledged in May to get rid of his earthly possessions, saying in an interview that his time is better spent thinking about putting a human on Mars.

“Don’t need the cash,” the eccentric billionaire tweeted at the time. “Possession just weigh you down.”

Musk sold his first LA mansion for $29 million in June, and followed that up in October by selling a 2,700 square foot ranch-style spread that used to belong to actor Gene Wilder for $7 million with the condition that it “cannot be torn down or lose any (of) its soul.”

The largest home — a six-bedroom, seven-bathroom mansion that sits on 1.5 acres of land — reportedly sold for $29.72 million.

Musk sold several pieces of property in 2020 after pledging to ""own no house."" He sold another Bel-Air home to a Chinese billionaire for $29 million in June, and he sold the estate that belonged to the actor Gene Wilder in October.

Elon Musk appears to be making good on his promise to ""own no house"": The Tesla billionaire has sold three more of his homes, the Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday.

On December 21 and 22, Musk — the world's second-richest person, with a net worth of $167 billion — sold three adjacent houses in the Bel-Air neighborhood of Los Angeles for a combined $40.9 million, the Times reported, citing property records.

The largest home — a six-bedroom, seven-bathroom mansion that sits on 1.5 acres of land — sold for $29.72 million. A 3,943-square-foot Colonial-style home across the street sold for $6.77 million, while the smallest house, a single-story 1960s home, sold for $4.43 million.

All three houses are on the same cul-de-sac in Bel-Air, according to the Times.

The Bel-Air homes are among several pieces of property Musk sold in 2020. In October, Musk sold the former estate of the actor Gene Wilder for $7 million, $250,000 more than Musk paid for it. The home was sold to an LLC managed by the screenwriter and producer Elizabeth Hunter, who is married to the filmmaker Jordan Walker-Pearlman, Wilder's nephew, Variety reported.

In June, Musk sold another Bel-Air home to a Chinese billionaire for $29 million, The Wall Street Journal reported. Musk had purchased the 20,248-square-foot home for $17 million in 2012.

Musk tweeted in May that he planned to sell ""almost all physical possessions"" and would ""own no house."" While Musk is known for making wild statements and grandiose pledges, he appears to be following through on his promise to offload at least some of his $100 million real-estate portfolio — though he said his girlfriend, the musician Grimes, was mad at him for making the decision days before they welcomed a new baby.

Earlier this month, Musk announced that he was moving to Texas following a months-long battle with California regulators. This spring, local officials barred Tesla from operating its factory in the San Francisco Bay Area during shelter-in-place orders, which Musk described as ""fascist"" and un-American.

AMD Ryzen chips to power new Tesla Model 3 & Model Y infotainment systems,2021-12-31T20:24:17Z,"On Tuesday, it was revealed via Teslascope (@teslascope on Twitter) that the 2022 Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles are expected to be equipped with new next-gen AMD Ryzen chips for their MCU3 Infotainment Computer, replacing the current Intel Atom A3950 chips in previous models.

AMD powers newest infotainment system on Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles for 2022 North American release

Previously this year, Tesla released their Model S and Model X autonomous vehicles with AMD's RDNA2 chips for their infotainment system. The Navi 22, Navi 23, and Navi 24 GPUs were expected to be in the two Tesla models, replacing the previous Intel chips.

The first Model 3 and Y vehicles with MCU3 (Infotainment Computer with AMD Ryzen) are now being produced and delivered in North America! pic.twitter.com/BHbpyKr78D — Teslascope (@teslascope) December 28, 2021

TESLA claims that their infotainment system allows for up to 10 TFLOPs of processing power which is on par with current-generation consoles such as the Sony PS5. The infotainment system comes with wireless controller compatibility and lets you game from any seat. And while TESLA doesn't mention any specs of this particular system, the hardware scene has a sense of what could be under the hood of the latest TESLA model S.

The Tesla Model 3 and Model Y vehicles originally shipped for a European market release, and on top of being equipped with the AMD Ryzen chipset for the new models, they are also anticipated to have a brand-new 12V Li-ion battery in the new 2022 models. Next year, Tesla will ship the Model 3 and Model Y to US markets.

The expectation on performance is high, with the newer AMD chipset and new 12V Li-ion battery to perform more efficiently and effectively for consumers, while offering a premium driving experience with the new changes. Elon Musk has mentioned that the infotainment system is comparable to a PlayStation 5 system, and has boasted that it can play Cyberpunk 2077.

Tesla prides itself on its center display, offering an experience like no other vehicle on the market. It is reported that their vehicles are built around the infotainment system, which would stand that the introduction of the more efficient AMD chipset would benefit all users.

New Model 3 and Y vehicles also include the new 12v battery. pic.twitter.com/oXw4w6S7YR — Teslascope (@teslascope) December 28, 2021

Previously, Tesla had failures due to the older 12V battery in their vehicles. There are reports stating that older battery chemistry is used for their battery to power the vehicle. It is unknown if this new battery will perform better, or will offer the same issues as the previous power option.

Tesla asks employees to fight California plan to cut solar incentives,2021-12-31T19:56:23Z,"A solar panel is displayed on a wall near signage at the entrance of the new Tesla Inc. showroom in New York.

While Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said he would prefer to stay out of politics — and that he opposes all subsidies — his electric car and solar business is asking employees to protest a policy proposal in California that would cut solar incentives in the state, according to company correspondence obtained by CNBC.

There are at least 1.3 million residential solar customers in the state today.

Among other things, the policy proposal would reduce payments made to solar customers in California for excess power that their systems generate and send back to the grid. It would also add monthly grid-connection charges for solar customers, effectively making rooftop solar more expensive for California residents.

If implemented, the changes could make it harder for Tesla and its competitors to sell customers on a residential solar installation in the state or generate profit from systems it leases.

Proponents say that such changes to California's net energy metering policy would help more residents to install energy storage systems, like Tesla's Powerwall or LG Chem's RESU battery, at their homes through rebates, and bring renewable energy to low-income or polluted neighborhoods.

The state Public Utilities Commission views current rates as a large subsidy for homeowners who are mostly well-off.

But solar power advocates have slammed the proposed changes, as CNBC previously reported, while the state's largest utilities have voiced their approval.

Here's what Tesla is telling its energy employees to do in response to the policy proposal (transcribed by CNBC):

Announcement - Net Energy Metering 3.0

Date: Dec. 22, 2021

NEM 3.0 is a proposal under consideration at the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) that reduces the benefit of going solar for customers of PG&E, SCE and SDG&E.

Tesla billionaire Elon Musk’s Twitter remarks have influenced markets on everything from crypto to stock prices,2021-12-31T19:46:34Z,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s Twitter posts have impacted markets throughout 2021. From GameStop, to Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies, to the price of Tesla stocks, the billionaire has made his mark.

Video Transcript

- He has a Legion of adoring fans that hang on to every single word he says, so he's got 68 million Twitter followers. But it's clear this man who wants to send people to Mars and drive cars without gasoline has the ability to drive markets as well. Back in January, believe it or not, when meme stock frenzy was at a high, and GameStop mania was all the rage, a one word tweet he linked to Wall Street Bets was Gamestonk if you remember that. And that sent the stock soaring from about $150 to nearly $350 a piece.

In February, Dogecoin apparently caught Musk's eye. It was the first time many people had even ever heard of the crypto. Dogecoin to the Moon sent the crypto surging 35%. People couldn't buy into Doge quickly enough. In fact, by the time he appeared on SNL, Doge was at an all time high.

But by October, a Shiba Inu became the new rage, and the crypto took off. But he still lent his support to Doge, tweeting, ""Tuition is in Dogecoin, and you can get a discount if you have a dog."" And just last month, he moved away from crypto talk and started talking about the colossal amount of taxes you would have to pay as the richest man in the world and asked Twitter followers if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock to help pay the bill. The stock tanked more than 20%, falling into bear territory before picking up just last week after Musk said you sold enough now to pay his estimated $11 billion in taxes.",https://finance.yahoo.com/video/tesla-billionaire-elon-musk-twitter-194634279.html

I have 4-wheel-drive and the CHP officer said I needed chains,2021-12-31T13:38:13Z,"Q: Ed Mocarsk claims you don’t need chains if you have an 4WD vehicle. That is not the case.

I was stopped once heading to Kirkwood from Tahoe by the CHP, making sure my vehicle had four-wheel drive, and that I had chains. I did not have any, thinking that I did not need them. I was informed that it was necessary to carry chains, even for 4WD vehicles.

The officer explained that in R3 (blizzard) conditions, the only vehicles allowed are 4WD with chains. I’ve never experienced R3, as I thought they closed the road before that. That was about 15 years ago, so maybe they have changed the rules?

Mike Greenwood, San Jose

A: The rules have not changed. All vehicles are required to carry chains, and to put them on when conditions require it.

Another mistake, as we could see in reports from the Sierra blizzard this week, is that some drivers ignore official road warnings, and believe their GPS, which may not factor in extreme weather conditions on side roads.

Q: You can’t listen to AM radio in a Tesla, but you can play video games? Yeah, sure, that makes sense.

Terri Lehan, San Jose

A: Tesla has seen the error in allowing video games to be played while the car is moving. That function will be disabled until the car is parked. Hopefully, common sense will prevail with features they release in the future.

Q: Crazy that Teslas don’t have AM radio. The good news is that KCBS (106.9 FM) and KNBR (104.5 FM) simulcast on FM stations so you can get the all-news station and listen to Giants games.

Susan Krauss, Alameda

A: Play ball! Less than two months before pitchers and catchers report, if the lockout ends in time.

Q: Can you ask Caltrans why the overhead freeway signs that were installed just a few years ago are already losing reflectivity? I drive on Interstate 680 through Concord to Highway 4 every day, and in the early hours, this is an issue.

Is this a problem with all their newer signs, or just at the location I cited?

Andrew Pierce, Pleasant Hill

A: I have not heard about this problem from anyone else, at least so far. These signs should be good for six to 10 years before needing to be upgraded.

Q: Rather than discarding string lights, please let your readers know that they can be disposed of as e-waste.

There will be a free e-waste drop-off and Goodwill truck fundraiser for Westmont’s Theatre Arts boosters on Saturday, Jan. 29 (9 a.m.- 2 p.m.) at 4805 Westmont Ave., Campbell.

"Tesla broke labor laws by telling workers not to discuss pay, NLRB claims",2022-12-31T21:17:39Z,"Tesla’s accused of violating national labor laws by allegedly telling employees at its Orlando, Florida location not to talk about pay and working conditions, as first reported by Bloomberg . In a complaint filed in September , the National Labor Relations Board’s (NLRB) regional director in Tampa claims Telsa “told employees not to complain to higher level managers about their pay or other conditions of employment” and said “not to discuss their pay with other persons.”

The complaint goes on to accuse Tesla of instructing employees not to discuss the hiring, suspension, or termination of employees with others. These incidents occurred from December 2021 to January 2022, the complaint alleges, and violates laws that prevent companies from “interfering with, restraining and coercing employees in the exercise of rights guaranteed” by the NLRB Act.

Tesla's New Year offers for car buyers in China. Details here,2022-12-31T18:30:00Z,"On the occasion of New Year 2023, Tesla Inc has come up with exclusive incentive offers for its vehicle buyers. These offers are aimed at popping up sales in China, according to Bloomberg news.

The company is offering Model 3 sedan and Model Y sport utility vehicle buyers as much as 10,000 yuan ($1,450) if they take delivery by February 28, according to Tesla’s website.

In addition, the carmaker is also extending a 6,000-yuan subsidy it started offering in early December, and the other 4,000-yuan subsidy tied to purchasing insurance through Tesla was first introduced in November, as per Bloomberg reports.

Concerns about demand in China contributed to Tesla shares plunging 37% in December, the most dismal month in what also was the stock’s worst-ever year. While the automaker is expected to announce record quarterly deliveries in early January, it’s already ruled out meeting its objective to grow by 50% for the year.

Tesla also offered discounts in the US to close out the year, first dangling $7,500 off just the Model 3 and Y, then extending that offer to the more expensive Model S and X.

Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk advised the staff not to be ""bothered by stock market craziness"" after the company's shares dropped over 70% this year due to concerns about waning demand of electric vehicles and Musk's distraction from running Twitter.

He opined that Tesla will eventually be the most valuable company on the planet in an email to staff that was sent on Wednesday and reviewed by Reuters. Musk also urged staff to increase deliveries at the end of this quarter after the automaker provided discounts on its cars in China and the US.",https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/teslas-new-year-offers-for-car-buyers-in-china-details-here-11672537315341.html
Tesla Is Down 62%: Is This Canadian EV Parts Company Better?,2022-12-31T15:30:00Z,"Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), once one of the most hyped stocks in the world, is down 69% for the year. Thanks to founder Elon Musk’s controversial Twitter acquisition, investors have lost faith that TSLA stock will rise. In order to pay Twitter’s bills, Musk has had to sell copious amounts of Tesla stock. At this point, he has sold at least $23 billion worth of TSLA shares, and the number just keeps growing. After his recent $3.95 billion stock sale, Musk promised that no further sales would be forthcoming, but that hasn’t stopped him from in the past. In August, after closing a $6.88 sale, Musk was asked whether he would stop selling, and he said “yes.”

“Yes. In the (hopefully unlikely) event that Twitter forces this deal to close and some equity partners don’t come through, it is important to avoid an emergency sale of Tesla stock.” Elon Musk

At this point, Tesla stock is looking pretty risky. It will find a bottom at some point, but as long as Musk keeps on selling, the bottom may be a ways off, which leads naturally to the question: is there a better electric vehicle (EV) stock to bet your money on?

Tesla isn’t the only EV company in the world, and some of its competitors are pretty good. In this article I’ll be looking at a Canadian company that, while not being a true EV company, does have an interesting business in EV parts.

Magna International

Magna International (TSX:MG) is a Canadian car parts company that recently got into the EV parts business by partnering with the South Korean company LG. The Joint Venture that the companies launched is called LG Magna E-Powertrain. It manufactures a variety of electric car parts, including the following:

Electric motors

Inverters

On-board chargers

Integrated systems

In general, LG-Magna’s solutions provide the components that EVs need under the hood, leaving manufacturers free to focus on big-picture design decisions.

Why it could be better than Tesla

Magna International certainly isn’t going to grow like Tesla has in recent years, but it might be better in the sense of being safer.

In the investing world, there’s a concept known as “margin of safety,” which refers to how much a person can potentially lose when they make an investment. If a company owns $1 per share (with no debt), and there’s nothing that could cause that $1 to go away, then the investor should theoretically never see their holdings fall below $1. If it were to do so, then we’d have a violation of the law of one price, which says that two identical things should trade for the same price.

Magna International arguably has a margin of safety. It trades at 0.44 times sales and 1.59 times book value. If Magna fell 37%, it would be trading at exactly book value. It’s already trading for less than a year’s worth of sales. Based on what Magna owns and earns, its stock should not go too much lower than its current price. This is simplifying a little, because an increase in debt, or higher interest rates, could cause book value to be reduced. Magna is not really 100% safe. But it does look like it’s safer, in valuation terms, than a company like Tesla that trades at 10 times book value.",https://www.fool.ca/2022/12/31/tesla-is-down-62-is-this-canadian-ev-parts-company-better/

Elon Musk thinks Greta Thunberg is 'cool' after her Twitter spat with Andrew Tate,2022-12-31T12:13:00Z,"Elon Musk said he thought Greta Thunberg was ""cool"" in a tweet on Friday.

The Tesla CEO was responding to a satirical article about Thunberg by The Babylon Bee.

His comments came after the environmental campaigner's Twitter spat with influencer Andrew Tate.

Elon Musk has waded into the social media spat between environmental activist Greta Thunberg and controversial influencer and kickboxer Andrew Tate.

The Tesla CEO tweeted on Friday that the ""sheer amount of brand awareness achieved by Greta within a few years is astounding,"" in a response to a satirical Babylon Bee article called ""New Greta Thunberg Thermostat Scowls At You When You Turn The Heat Up.""

""I think she's cool tbh,"" Musk added.

His comments follow Thunberg's response to Tate's taunts about his car collection earlier this week.

The influencer, who has made misogynistic comments online, asked Thunberg for her email address so he could send a ""complete list"" of his 33 cars ""and their respective enormous emissions.""

She told Tate he could contact her at ""smalldickenergy@getalife.com.""

Thunberg's tweet has had 3.7 million likes, making it one of the most popular ever.

Related stories

Tate and his brother Tristan were arrested in Romania on Thursday in connection with allegations of human trafficking and rape, which they deny, BBC News reported. They and two Romanians will be detained for 30 days.

Musk's comments could be seen as a reaction to a suggestion this week by economist Paul Krugman that Musk's tack to the political right has put him at odds with Tesla's core customer base of wealthy, environmentally conscious liberals. Musk has ""gone full MAGA, turning off exactly the people who might buy his cars,"" Krugman tweeted.

Meanwhile, Tesla shares have lost almost two thirds of their value, or more than $700 billion, this year after the stock peaked in November 2021.

Musk's focus on ""fixing"" Twitter since he took control in late October has rattled some investors' confidence.

Some pleaded with the CEO to let someone else run Twitter and concentrate on Tesla, said Ross Gerber, head of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth and Investment Management and a Tesla shareholder, on a Twitter Space on December 20.

Analysts have also said that Twitter is distracting Musk from Tesla, while his politicized tweets have damaged the EV maker's brand as well.

Tesla driver found sleeping at the wheel as car reached 70 mph on highway, report says

A driver fell asleep while his Tesla car was using its autopilot assistance system on a German highway.

Police tried to stop the driver as the car reached up to 70 mph, The Times of London reported.

Police spent 15 minutes trying to wake him. He had his license confiscated pending an investigation.

German police stopped a Tesla driver who fell asleep at the wheel with the car's Autopilot assistance system on, according to The Times of London.

The car reached close to 70 mph on the highway in Bavaria, Germany, while the 45-year-old driver continued to snooze, the newspaper reported.

Police spent close to 15 minutes unsuccessfully trying to wake the driver by honking their horn and signaling him to stop, The Times said.

The Upper Franconia Police Directorate first suspected the car was on autopilot when it maintained a constant distance from the police patrol vehicle, which was traveling at 110 kmh (68.3 mph), according to the newspaper.

""The officers noticed that the Tesla driver was leaning back in his seat with his eyes closed and his hands were not on the steering wheel,"" police said, per The Times. ""This reinforced the suspicion that he had let the autopilot take over and had fallen asleep.""

Police said he eventually woke up and pulled over, showing ""drug-related symptoms,"" The Times reported.

The newspaper said that police found a steering wheel weight in the footwell of the vehicle, a device that mimics the weight of hands on the wheel, allowing a driver to take their hands off and continue to drive. The device overrides Tesla's safety feature.

The driver had his license confiscated pending an investigation on a charge of endangering road traffic, per The Times.

Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO, has championed the car company's Autopilot assistance system. Last December, he said Tesla doesn't get ""rewarded"" for the people Autopilot saves.

However, Tesla vehicles have been the focus of several special crash investigations opened by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), Reuters reported.

NHTSA has opened 41 special crash investigations since 2016 involving Tesla cars where advanced driver assistance systems, such as Autopilot, were believed to have been used, according to Reuters.

Insider previously reported that vehicles using Tesla's Autopilot software were involved in 273 crashes in the US from July 2021 to May 2022.

More than a dozen fatal crashes in the US have involved automated driver assist systems, Dailymail.com reported last month.

Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and seven other tech billionaires lost a collective $575 billion in 2022

Ten of the world's tech billionaires lost a combined $575 billion in 2022 as stocks tumbled.

Inflation, a strong US dollar, and a tough digital-ad market took a toll on tech companies.

Here are the tech billionaires who lost the most money, according to Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.

Net-worth figures are as of December 30.

Steve Ballmer, the former CEO of Microsoft, lost $19.4 billion.

The wealth of Ballmer, who was the CEO of Microsoft from 2000 to 2014, is mainly tied up in shares of the tech behemoth. At the end of this year, he was worth $86.2 billion.

In 2022, the company's growth slowed as it faced less demand for personal computers and a stronger US dollar. Sales of its Windows operating system fell, and its stock followed, falling by 28% over the year. Microsoft told investors to expect weak sales of personal computers into the new year.

Most of Zeng's wealth comes from his 23% stake in Contemporary Amperex Technology, the largest supplier of electric-vehicle batteries. His net worth rounding out the year was $32.5 billion.

In April, the company reported its sharpest decline in quarterly earnings, with net income falling by 24%. Earlier in the year, prices for nickel, a major component of electric-car batteries, and other raw materials were unstable.

Bill Gates, a cofounder of Microsoft, lost $28.6 billion.

With a net worth of $110 billion at the end of 2022, Gates has investments spread across companies, real estate, and land, but his shares of Microsoft are his most valuable single holding.

Microsoft's stock lost close to 30% of its value last year, as sales of Windows fell and the company predicted slow growth for its cloud revenue.

MacKenzie Scott, a novelist and philanthropist, lost $37.3 billion.

Like that of her ex-husband Jeff Bezos, Scott's net worth suffered from Amazon's stock drop last year. Most of Scott's wealth comes from a 3% stake in Amazon, whose shares tumbled by 50% in 2022. As the year ended, she was worth $19 billion.

She said in a blog post in November that she'd given nearly $2 billion this year to 343 organizations supporting underserved communities.

Sergey Brin, a cofounder of Google, lost $44 billion.

Brin and his cofounder Larry Page lost a collective $89 billion in 2022 as Alphabet and other tech companies dealt with a difficult year for digital advertising. Brin's net worth sat at $79.5 billion as the year came to a close.

Like Page, Brin gets most of his wealth from his stake in Alphabet, Google's parent company.

Both Brin's and Page's net worth fell last year as Alphabet struggled with digital advertising. Most of Page's wealth — he was worth $83.1 billion at the end of the year — comes from his 6% stake in Alphabet.

Alphabet slowed its hiring in 2022, and reportedly cut back on employee travel and offsite perks.

Mark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Meta, lost $79.9 billion.

At the end of 2021 Zuckerberg was the sixth-richest person in the world, but he ended 2022 at No. 25 on the list, with $45.6 billion.

Revenue at Meta, formerly Facebook, fell last year as it faced a potential economic recession and a hard year for digital advertising.

Meta laid off 11,000 employees last fall to cut expenses as it works on building the metaverse.

Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao, the cofounder and CEO of Binance, lost $83.3 billion.

Most of Zhao's net worth, which sat at $12.6 billion at the end of 2022, comes from his controlling stake in the cryptocurrency exchange Binance.

Since the collapse of FTX, which sought help from Binance before it filed for bankruptcy, the crypto market has faced scrutiny from investors worried about their assets.

Last month, Binance customers withdrew billions from the crypto platform. Because of the withdrawals and fluctuations in crypto prices, Binance held about $54.7 billion worth of digital assets in mid-December, while over a month earlier it held $69.5 billion worth of assets.

The Department of Justice is said to be investigating the firm over allegations of money laundering.

Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon and Blue Origin, lost $85.2 billion.

Bezos' wealth fell as Amazon's stock dropped this year. Anadolu Agency / Getty Images

Bezos, who stepped down as Amazon's CEO in 2021, is still the company's largest shareholder. But tech stocks fell last year, and the value of Amazon's shares fell by 50%. Bezos was worth $107 billion as 2022 came to a close.

Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla, SpaceX, and Twitter, lost $132 billion.

Musk recently lost his title as the richest person in the world to Bernard Arnault, the CEO of LVMH. Now the second-richest person on Earth, Musk had a fortune of $138 billion at the end of 2022.

A lot of Musk's wealth is tied up in shares of Tesla. The electric-car maker's stock plummeted by almost 70% last year, in part because investors grew concerned by Musk's takeover of Twitter.

Tesla's stock was also a victim of weakening demand for electric vehicles, specifically in China, one of Tesla's largest markets.

Cathie Wood warns GM and Ford electric vehicles slowdown is a mistake-one that will help Tesla and Elon Musk,2023-12-31T22:02:44Z,"Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has long been bullish on Elon Musk and Tesla. She’s also been expecting Detroit automakers to follow the path Musk has forged with electric vehicles.

“We expected a lot of traditional auto manufacturers to see the writing on the wall and rush as quickly as they could into scaling big-time into electric vehicles,” she told Bloomberg Surveillance this week.

Instead, they’ve been decelerating their EV plans, wary of EV growth that—while still strong—has lately slowed. Wood, coming off her best month ever in November after a wobbly stretch, views their decisions as being good for Tesla in the long run.

General Motors had planned to build 400,000 EVs over a roughly two-year stretch ending in mid-2024. But in October, it abandoned that target, with CFO Paul Jacobson citing a slowdown in the EV market. Production of the electric pickup trucks Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra in suburban Detroit would be delayed by a year, the company said.

This month, Ford said it’s cutting production goals for its signature F-150 Lightning pickup, down from 3,200 to 1,600 per week due to slowing demand. And in November, it restarted work on a EV battery plant, but with scaled-back ambitions, saying it would produce roughly 40% fewer batteries than planned.

While EV growth has slowed in recent months, it’s still robust. According to J.D. Power, some 869,000 fully electric vehicles were sold in the U.S. in the first 10 months of 2023—a 56% jump over the year-ago period, but a slowdown from two years earlier.

“The narrative has taken over that EVs aren’t growing,” Ford CFO John Lawler said in October. “They’re growing . . . It’s just growing at a slower pace than the industry, and quite frankly, we, expected.”

Ford recorded a $1.3 billion loss in its EV division in the third quarter, and has forecast a full-year loss of $4.5 billion for the unit.

But such losses are necessary and expected, believes Wood:

“Both GM and Ford have said, ‘We're stepping back. We're not going to do this until it's profitable.’ The problem with that is in order to be profitable, they need to scale. That's how this works. These are learning curves that they are writing down, and those are expressed in cost declines.""

Their hesitation, however, will only benefit Tesla more, she thinks.

“The fact that they're pulling back,” she said, “means there's more share for Tesla and others who choose to go for it.”",https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cathie-wood-warns-gm-ford-220244486.html
"Tesla SUV spotted in Bengaluru traffic; netizens ask, ‘Did no one break the glass?’",2023-12-31T18:30:00Z,"A Tesla Model X was recently spotted in Bengaluru's traffic, creating a buzz among social media users, who engaged in a guessing game as to whether the vehicle was privately owned or if the Elon Musk-led company was conducting test drives in Bengaluru.

The ultra-red Tesla SUV was reportedly spotted in Bengaluru's Minsk Square area near the Cubbon Park metro station. However, the sight of a Tesla vehicle in the familiar Bengaluru traffic sparked many hilarious reactions from social media users.

The picture of the Tesla car in Bengaluru traffic was first shared by a handle called North BangalorePost on X (formerly Twitter). The handle suggested that Tesla was testing its vehicles in Bengaluru, a claim that many netizens disagreed with.

Replying with a hilarious post on X, one user wrote, “In banglore?? Did no one break the glass? Tesla is not a Kannada word”

“Saw the same vehicle in Koramangala a few days back I think it's some private vehicle.” Another X user noted

“It’s not test drive, some one is on official visit and driving his car from Dubai… which is very much allowed for limited period.” Yet another one said.

Sharing some information about the Tesla EV, one user wrote,“The car showing belongs to one who imported through CARNET from Dubai. Otherwise a test drive vehicle would carry a number plate with red BG and white text colour.”

According to a Moneycontrol report, Tesla had incorporated an Indian arm named Tesla India Motors and Energy Private Ltd in preparation for setting up a manufacturing plant along with a research and development wing in India.

How India will navigate EVs in 2024,2023-12-30T01:00:04Z,"India, a major player in the global automotive industry, has started focusing on transitioning to alternative fuels to curb pollution after expanding its consumer and vehicle bases and adding local manufacturing facilities over the past two decades. On this journey, 2024 will be a crucial year, as the country — the third-largest automotive market — faces challenges to offer accessible growth capital to late-stage startups while trying to lure Tesla and other foreign EV manufacturers to enter its domestic market.

How EVs fared in 2023

In 2023, India, the world’s largest two- and three-wheeler manufacturer, sold almost 24 million vehicles, including commercial and personal four-, three- and two-wheelers, according to the latest data on the government’s Vahan portal. Of the total number of vehicles registered, more than 1.5 million were EVs, capturing 6.35% of the total base, including 813,000 electric two-wheelers. While the overall growth was nearly 10% from about 22 million vehicles sold in 2022, EV sales grew by close to 47% from 1.03 million EVs sold last year.

This brings the total number of electric vehicle sales in the country to nearly 3.5 million. Two-wheelers accounted for more than 47% of sales, four-wheelers represented about 8% and the rest came from e-rickshaws and three-wheelers.

India’s annual growth in EV sales in 2023 is significant; however, it’s not as high as in the previous two years, which were over 209% in 2022 and 166% in 2021. One of the reasons for the dip in the sales of EVs is the cut in subsidies given to two-wheeler customers through the $1.38 billion incentive scheme called Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of (Hybrid and) Electric Vehicles, commonly called FAME-II, that came into effect in June and dropped the monthly sales of electric two-wheelers in the country over 56% in that month alone. The sudden drop in electric two-wheeler sales has arguably impacted the country’s overall EV market, as India is predominantly a two-wheeler market and has limited manufacturers in the electric car segment.

Ravneet S. Phokela, chief business officer of electric two-wheeler startup Ather Energy, told TechCrunch the market took a hit for about three months due to the FAME-II update, though it has rebounded to pre-subsidy change levels as of October.

“From the bounce back, how the rapid growth is going to be remains to be seen, but we expect it to be more gradual than exponential. However, the days of 100% quarter-on-quarter growth are gone,” he said over a call, adding that the change would help in the medium-term perspective.

“In a way, while the subsidy impacted us in the short term financially, if I just take a macro view, there has actually been a good outcome because now, the market pricing is close to non-subsidy levels, which means the market has gotten used to price levels that we can explore broadly when subsidy goes over,” Phokela noted.

The subsidy update has also caused consolidation and sudden exits of many small-scale electric two-wheeler brands, including the ones selling rebranded Chinese vehicles. Phokela said that the top four players, namely Ola, TVS Motor, Ather Energy and Bajaj, which combined had around 26% to 27% share about nine months ago (before the government updated FAME-II in May), currently capture about 80% of the total electric two-wheeler market.

Ather Energy sold an average of about 80,000 to 85,000 units this year and expects a similar sales figure for 2024, Phokela said.

Apart from electric two-wheelers, the FAME-II scheme applies to three- and four-wheeler sales to boost EV consumption in the country.

New Delhi has given more than $628 million in subsidies through December 1 under FAME-II on the sale of 1.15 million vehicles, according to the government data shared in the parliament.

EV manufacturers have demanded that the government continue offering subsidies to let the market sustain its growth and expand further to meet the country’s electrification target to have 30% EV penetration by 2030.

“Given that the costs are still not optimized yet for the supply chain, it is important for the government to continue the subsidy for two to three years and taper it down,” Phokela said.

Industry sources told TechCrunch that market players have requested the government provide predictability in its policies and avoid bringing abrupt changes, such as the case of FAME-II updates, to let them make assumptions and base financial and business planning accordingly.

“A lack of predictability is the biggest killer point for the industry,” an executive at an electric two-wheeler company stated on the condition anonymity. “Even if you are saying six months, please tell us that it will be for six months and then turnaround, but don’t say two years and end in one year.”

In addition to FAME-II, the Indian government has offered a $3.11 billion production-linked incentive scheme to attract investments and push domestic manufacturing of automobile and auto components in the country. Indian car manufacturers Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra have emerged as the early beneficiaries of the incentive scheme. The government reported more than $1.43 billion of investments came until the second quarter of the financial year 2023-24 as a result of the scheme.

Tata Motors saw a growth of 63% in EVs and increased EV penetration in its portfolio to 12% this year, a company spokesperson said in a statement to TechCrunch.

Automobile manufacturers, including Ather Energy and Tata Motors, introduced their new EV models in the country to expand their presence and attract new customers.

Phokela underlined that “premiumization” emerged as a notable consumer trend this year, particularly in the Indian electric two-wheeler market. The trend of premium models coming to the market will continue in 2024, he predicted.

All four top electric two-wheeler brands have vehicles between the price range of $1,400 to $1,800, while the traditional internal combustion engine two-wheelers are available at an average price of $1,000.

In the last 12 to 18 months, the electric two-wheeler market also saw growing sales from the tier two and tier three towns. For Ather Energy, Phokela said only 43% of its sales came from tier one cities, while 57% was from tier two and tier three towns — despite its limited distribution in those regions. The startup is now expanding its distribution to get even higher sales.

Some market observers believe that the growth of electric two-wheeler sales in the developing parts of India is due to hefty electricity subsidies. However, Phokela argued that if that were the reason, there would be a significant growth in the demand for low-end vehicles, not the premium models. People in non-metro cities consider EVs as status validation and a way to show off, he said.

Commercial use cases as a major investor attraction

Although top electric two-wheeler manufacturers have so far targeted the personal mobility segment in the Indian market, investors are bullish on the growth of commercial use cases.

“In the next two to three years, the majority of the traction will come from B2B use cases — whether it is three-wheeler cargo, three-wheeler passenger, eco-mobility, food delivery, hyperlocal delivery, fast/quick commerce, the use of EVs there is the one that’s accelerating much faster,” Kunal Khattar, founder and general partner at Indian VC fund AdvantEdge Founders, told TechCrunch.

He said while the share of commercial vehicles is about 30 million, or 10% of the total number of vehicles on the road in India, they consume almost 70% of the energy of all the vehicles.

“If you’re in the business of energy, whether it is battery manufacturing or swapping, energy storage or building charging infrastructure, your entire focus should be on B2B,” he noted.

Sandiip Bhammer, founder and co-managing partner at New York-based climate tech VC fund Green Frontier Capital, told TechCrunch the opportunity to gain faster and more rapid growth in the commercial segment is significantly higher than in the consumer segment.

“The economic viability of two-wheeler and three-wheeler segments on the commercial side is much clearer than on the passenger car segment,” he said.

Investors believe that compared to the consumer segment, the commercial segment is less prone to be impacted by subsidy changes. This is because businesses consider the total cost of ownership rather than the face value of the vehicle they purchase.

Khattar said the B2B segment will be 100% electric in India in the next two to three years, irrespective of whether subsidies and other incentives would be available.

The country plans to add thousands of battery-operated auto-rickshaws and e-buses to electrify public transportation across states in the coming months. Likewise, it looks to offer EV charging stations at various local gas stations.

Capital flow in the market

Equity investments in India’s electric vehicle (EV) market decreased by 52%, from $2.1 billion in 2022 to $1 billion in 2023, according to the data shared with TechCrunch by VC analyst firm Tracxn earlier this month. The number of funding rounds also dropped 62%, from 135 in the previous year to 51. However, EV funding was not as dire as in some top-performing sectors, such as tech, SaaS, agritech and health tech, where equity investments dropped by over 80%.

Bhammer of Green Frontier Capital said the drop in EV funding this year was mainly due to valuations that were too high in many of the existing startups.

“If you look at new companies that are raising capital, they are actually raising capital at a much more reasonable valuation than the older companies doing extension rounds,” he said.

Investors are optimistic about the capital flow growth in 2024 but cautious about muted numbers, particularly in the consumer segment, due to FAME-II changes and lack of clarity on subsidy extension.

“We need the support of the government, in terms of subsidies and taxes and all of that, because of the fact that we are not mainstream yet,” Khattar of AdvantEdge Founders said.

One key reason for being hopeful is India’s growing global presence and becoming a part of the China+1 strategy for most global companies.

“China has now started de-growing. So, India is the beacon of hope in an otherwise pretty dull emerging markets scenario,” Bhammer said.

What’s coming up next?

While India is still a nascent market for EVs, global EV companies including Tesla and VinFast are also looking to enter the Indian market in the coming months to leverage the size of the world’s most populous nation. The Indian government is developing a new EV policy to attract foreign carmakers to foray into the market alongside supporting domestic players to expand the country’s electric car base. Incumbents including India’s top carmaker Maruti Suzuki are also closely observing the ongoing moves by international players to look for the right time to enter the market.

“Legacy carmakers are in no hurry. When they launch, they will distribute, and through their distribution, they will be able to start selling numbers as much as, if not more than, existing players,” an EV investor told TechCrunch.

Companies including Tata Motors, which are already in the EV market with their vehicles, are working to address the current adoption challenges.

“Charging infrastructure growth remains the residual barrier for mass adoption of EVs. Tata Motors has initiated open collaboration with key charging players to accelerate the growth of chargers, which will deliver a better experience to the EV buyers,” the Tata Motors spokesperson said.

Ravi Pandit, co-founder and group chairman of automobile tech company KPIT Technologies, told TechCrunch that software and hardware have become the vehicle’s core and that trend will continue to grow over time.

“Now, the model is changing where instead of there being a lot of computers in a car, there will be a computer and around which there will be a car. That’s a fundamental shift,” he said.

Similarly, electric two-wheeler manufacturers and infrastructure providers are working on standardized charging solutions. Ather Energy has already collaborated with Hero to offer interoperability on charging.

“We have about 1,400 fast chargers, and Hero Vida has about 500, and we are growing on a monthly basis,” said Phokela. “We are in conversations with many other OEMs, and these discussions are at different levels of maturity.”

In addition to standardization and interoperability on the charging side, some companies are exploring alternatives to lithium, including sodium-ion-driven technologies and silicon anode.

“What is clear is that you cannot drive revolution in any sector unless you have access to the raw materials that power the industry. So, if China controls the refining capacity of lithium, how would India drive the EV revolution if it has to keep going to China for its batteries,” Bhammer said.

He mentioned that other incoming updates in the market include vehicle-to-grid and clip-on devices that will be available on a subscription-based model to help users convert an existing two-wheeler from a non-EV to an EV without charging the motor or battery permanently.",https://techcrunch.com/2023/12/29/india-ev-market-2024/
"Weekly Tech recap: Jio's New Year Plan, Tesla robot incident and more",2023-12-29T18:30:00Z,"In a week packed with significant developments, legal battles took center stage as The New York Times (NYT) filed a lawsuit against Microsoft and OpenAI, accusing them of unauthorized use of NYT's content to build artificial intelligence models, namely ChatGPT and Copilot.

Nordic workers took on Elon Musk in 2023. Here’s what could happen next,2023-12-29T11:26:24Z,"London CNN —

What began nine weeks ago with a group of mechanics in Sweden demanding that Tesla agree to collective bargaining has evolved into a broader fight for the Nordic region’s way of work and life.

The stakes are high, too, for the carmaker and its CEO Elon Musk, the world’s richest man.

Bowing to union pressure in Sweden could embolden Tesla (TSLA) workers in Germany — home to the company’s only European factory — who, likewise, want a collective agreement on pay and other terms of employment. It could also fire up unionization efforts by Tesla’s US workforce.

For labor unions across the Nordics — a region encompassing Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland — the tussle with Tesla and Musk, a vocal critic of unions, is existential.

“If a large international company is allowed to (impose itself) on the Swedish labor market and not sign a collective agreement, then what’s to say that other companies in the future will accept this (existing) model?” Jesper Petersson, a spokesperson for IF Metall, which represents the Tesla mechanics, told CNN.

For more than a century, Nordic labor unions have helped set their members’ terms of employment by negotiating with employers and signing collective bargaining agreements.

According to the most recent data from the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), on average, 83% of all workers in the five countries are covered by such negotiations.

Governments in the Nordics prefer collective bargaining to legislating a minimum wage, which exists in most other European nations.

But a Tesla subsidiary in Sweden refused to sign a collective agreement with IF Metall. In response, some of the 120 mechanics employed by Tesla to service its cars in the country went on strike in late October and have not returned to work. The union declined to say how many mechanics were still on strike.

The role of collective agreements in Sweden’s labor market is “fundamental and profound,” according to Mikael Hansson, an associate professor specializing in labor law at the country’s Uppsala University.

﻿So a wave of “sympathy strikes” has followed. Swedish dockworkers have blocked deliveries of Tesla cars at the country’s ports, electricians have refused to service charging stations, and postal workers have even stopped delivering license plates. “This is insane,” was Musk’s response to the latter development.

By early December, unions representing dockworkers in Denmark, Norway and Finland had announced plans to block all exports of Tesla cars to Sweden from their ports.

IF Metall is paying the striking mechanics up to 130% of their usual wages, including contributions to their pensions and vacation funds, said Petersson at the union.

“We are prepared to go on (for) as long as it takes.”

Investors back the workers

Swedish workers have fought — and won — this battle before. Toys R Us attempted to resist collective bargaining when it arrived in the country in 1995, but relented following three months of industrial action, which included sympathy strikes.

This time, Nordic investors have also joined the fray. A group of 16 institutional investors, including pension funds and asset managers﻿, urged Tesla in a letter, sent earlier this month and seen by CNN, to respect the region’s tradition of collective bargaining and expressed “deep concern” over the company’s attitude to unions.

PensionDanmark, a Danish fund, which co-signed the letter﻿, has voted with its feet. It announced earlier this month that it had sold its $70 million stake in the carmaker, citing Tesla’s “very categorical denial” of collective agreements.

Laura Carlson, a law professor at Stockholm University, can’t recall another case of a divestment aimed at upholding the Nordic region’s labor traditions. And she thinks Tesla is unlikely to prevail in its attempt to bypass them.

“Collective agreements are the foundation of labor law in Sweden,” she told CNN.

Hansson at Uppsala University agrees.

“I have difficulty seeing the trade unions lose. They have invested too much. They really can’t lose this battle,” he said.

Tesla told CNN in a statement that its employees “are rewarded with fair terms and working conditions.” “This is why Tesla, like many other companies, has chosen not to enter into a collective agreement,” it added, declining to answer specific questions.

Next stop Germany?

The stakes are relatively low for Tesla in Sweden.

The country represented just over 6% of Tesla’s sales in Europe in the first 10 months of the year, according to Matthias Schmidt, an independent auto market analyst.

The bigger risk to the company’s bottom line lies further south, in Germany, a country that accounted for almost 20% of its European sales over the same period, based on Schmidt’s data, and where the automaker has a factory capable of producing 375,000 cars a year for customers across the continent.

German law makes it prohibitively hard for workers to strike in solidarity with those elsewhere, but sympathy action in the Nordics “may act as a catalyst” for Tesla’s German workers to join local unions, Schmidt said.

For more than a year, workers at the Berlin plant have complained of grueling work schedules, staff shortages and strict production targets, according to Markus Sievers, a spokesperson for IG Metall, Germany’s biggest labor union.

He declined to say how many of the plant’s reported 11,000 workers had joined his union, but noted that it was adding members quickly, and that “a lot” had signed up this year.

“We are not yet at the point where we can arrange for a strike,” he told CNN. “We are still building up strength (in numbers).”

A demand on some of IG Metall members’ lips? A collective agreement, according to the union.

“The German trade unions are waiting for Tesla to give in,” said Hansson of Uppsala University. “And then they have a strong argument: If you can make an exception in Sweden, then (you can make) an exception in Germany.”

The road ahead

For Tesla and Musk, negotiating with unions would mean losing face.

The world’s biggest maker of electric cars has crushed several efforts by its US workforce to unionize. The country’s National Labor Relations Board has accused Tesla of interrogating, disciplining and discriminating against implicated workers.

Musk himself has made no secret of his disdain for unions. The federal agency has directed him to delete a 2018 tweet that hinted Tesla employees would lose their stock options if they formed a union.

More recently, he told the New York Times: “I disagree with the idea of unions,” adding that he thought they “naturally try to create negativity in a company.”

But protections for organized labor in the United States are much weaker than in Europe.

Carlson at Stockholm University said a realistic alternative to entering into a collective agreement in Sweden would be for Tesla to hire a contractor, which would then sign such an agreement. That would allow Musk to keep the union at arm’s length.

Amazon (AMZN) did something similar when it entered the Swedish market in 2020, contracting a German-Swiss logistics firm already signed up to a collective agreement with the Swedish Transport Workers’ Union to operate its warehouse in the country.

For now, Tesla has dug in. Earlier this month, it advertised for a role in Nordic legal and government affairs — specifically, someone “with a proven track record of getting regulatory changes made” in the region.

The successful candidate will help ensure “political, regulatory and fiscal frameworks” in the Nordics “support Tesla’s mission,” according to the advert posted on LinkedIn.

For Carlson, the new role shows ignorance of the Swedish context.

“That shows a complete lack of understanding with respect to what the system (of collective bargaining) is about, and with respect to how foundational it is in Swedish society — not just in the legal system,” she said.",https://edition.cnn.com/2023/12/29/business/elon-musk-tesla-nordic-strikes/index.html
First Tesla Cybertruck Crash On Public Roads Leaves Driver With 'Minor Injuries',2023-12-29T09:53:00Z,"The Tesla Cybertruck has been one of the biggest vehicle releases of 2023. Now that they are trickling out to eager deposit holders and Tesla continues to test them, it was only a matter of time until one was crashed on public roads. The first one happened yesterday, and it appears it held up rather well.

The California Highway Patrol reported that the incident happened on December 28 at around 2:05 PM local time on State Route 35, also known as Skyline Boulevard, outside San Jose. A driver in a Toyota Corolla went off the road and came back across the double yellow line to strike the Cybertruck going the other direction.

The Cybertruck driver suffered minor injuries but didn't require an ambulance to go to the hospital, the California Highway Patrol told The Autopian. The two passengers in the pickup were not hurt. The Corolla driver was unharmed.

Photos of the incident (above) suggest the Corolla sideswiped the Cybertruck. There are deep scratches along the pickup's driver's side, and the fender cladding around the wheels is missing. The impact was hard enough to cause the EV's side curtain airbag to deploy.

The Corolla incurred much more significant damage. However, it's unclear how much of the destruction came from initially leaving the road and what amount the impact with the Cybertruck caused. The Toyota's driver side took the brunt of the harm, suggesting this was from sideswiping the Tesla.

A dashcam video (below) from the crash scene provides another look at the crash scene. The Corolla ended up with its nose pointing towards the road. The Cybertruck was blocking a traffic lane with its nose off the shoulder.

There's not a good enough look at the Cybertruck to know whether the pickup is repairable. According to the Tesla parts catalog, a front fender costs $550 plus installation. The front fascia and powered frunk are a total of $2,845.75.

When Tesla launched the production-spec Cybertruck, Elon Musk touted it as ""much safer per mile"" than the other trucks in the class. ""Because the center of gravity is so low, it doesn't roll over,"" he said.

However, critics pushed back because a crash test video indicated the Cybertruck didn't have sufficient crumple zones to be safe in a head-on collision. There has been no independent testing from groups like the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety to evaluate the EV's safety at this time.

"Asda row, Tesla deal, dumping KFC... inside huge year for billionaire Issa brothers who started out with Bury petrol station",2023-12-29T07:01:05Z,"Asda row, Tesla deal, dumping KFC... inside huge year for billionaire Issa brothers who started out with Bury petrol station

Zuber and Mohsin Issa oversee a sprawling empire

Brothers Zuber (left) and Mohsin (right) Issa

After buying a petrol station on Brandlesholme Road in Bury, just over 20 years ago, they built a sprawling business empire worth billions. But since snapping up Asda for £6.8bn in February 2021, billionaire brothers Zuber and Mohsin Issa have come under greater scrutiny.

Here we take a look back at what's been a busy and at times dramatic year for the Blackburn-born entrepreneurs - which has seen them strike some massive deals, and face questions from politicians.

‌



Article continues below

The brothers, who according to the Sunday Times 2023 Rich List have a combined fortune of £5bn, recently sought to reassure MPs over the structure of their company and its tax and debt position.

""We would like to take this opportunity to confirm that no companies in the Asda ownership structure are incorporated in jurisdictions outside of England and Wales due to any 'tax haven' status,'"" Mohsin Issa wrote to MP Liam Byrne, chair of the business and trade committee.

""We can further confirm that all of the companies are UK tax residents regardless of where they are incorporated, they each file UK corporation tax returns and pay UK corporation tax on profits in accordance with UK tax legislation.""

Meanwhile, earlier in 2023, executives from the Issa brothers' owned Asda - and the UK's other big four supermarkets Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons - denied they were profiteering from customers who have witnessed soaring increases in their food bills during the cost-of-living crisis.

‌



But while the Issas have come under political scrutiny, their business, which includes the petrol station firm EG Group and fast food chain Leon, continues apace.

Earlier this week they unveiled plans to build an industrial estate on greenbelt land near the M65. If approved, it's said the venture will create up to 1,200 jobs.

‌



But concerns have been raised by local residents, while the Lancashire Telegraph reports one local councillor has expressed fears that radioactive waste was dumped down old mineshafts in the 1950s - a claim strongly disputed by the local authority's bosses.

Earlier this month the brothers sold off 200 KFC franchise restaurants they owned. EG Group, which also runs franchise sites for Starbucks, Greggs and Subway, among others, said the sale would help pay off some of its loans.

In a statement at the time the brothers said: ""Now is the right time to hand the baton to the KFC leadership team to continue to grow the brand in the UK. This is the latest transaction in our significant deleveraging this year – to put in place a sustainable capital structure.""

‌



In November the brothers struck an eye-catching, multi-million deal with Tesla to launch ultra-fast electric vehicle charging points across their empire of petrol stations. The so-called super chargers could initially only be used to charge Teslas, but have since been made available to all makes of car.

Speaking at the time, Zuber Issa hailed the deal as the 'first of its kind in Europe' He added: ""It is the first deal of its kind entered into by Tesla with a third-party charge point operator in Europe and will transform how our customers charge their vehicles and how they interact with EG. This deal will accelerate the delivery of vital charging infrastructure for motorists to help power the transition to net zero.""

‌



But the biggest deal the brothers struck in 2023 came in May, when Asda bought its sister business EG Group’s UK and Irish operations for £2.27 billion, bringing together the two sides of the Issas' business. It was said proceeds from the sale would be used, as well as the £1.1 billion it gained from a deal in the US, to pay down what the company owes.

The combined company was expected to be worth around £10bn, have revenues of around £30bn and employ around 170,000 people. Reports at the time said EG had a debt pile of around £7bn.

After the deal was announced Asda and EG Group chairman Lord Stuart Rose tried to bat away concerns it was simply moving debt from EG Group to Asda. He said: ""The primary driver of this deal was creating a business, which is a different business and a multi-channel champion to what we were able to do before by bringing in convenience, etc, etc, and scaling up with opportunities.

‌

""Now, if as a consequence of that, you’ve also got the opportunity of deleveraging on the upside, then what’s wrong with that?""

The GMB union said the merger could risk jobs, food supplies and monopolise petrol stations across the UK. Before the deal went through the union wrote to Business Secretary Kemi Badenoch urging her to call in the competition regulator to investigate.

‌



The union likened the move to the demise of Debenhams, which fell into administration in 2019, having been saddled with some £1bn in debt. ""Reckless financial engineering that risks these jobs must be subject to proper scrutiny and the owners held accountable for decisions which may impact this,"" the letter signed by GMB’s national officer Nadine Houghton, read.

EG Group is due to refinance its debt pile by 2025, at a time when interest rates have risen sharply. In the week before Christmas Mohsin Issa told MPs there were 'no gaps' in Asda's finances as he yet again faced questions over the company's accounting structures.

He said nobody should be concerned about Asda's debts, despite confirming it has £4.2 billion of debts on its books. When asked if he had any worries about its degree of debt, Mr Issa said: ""No, I don't.

Article continues below

""What I would say is that the debt leverage at the start of the year was at 4.2 times, that has gone down to 3.8 times and that trajectory is to go down even further by the end of this year. At the same time, we are investing in colleague pay, customer pricing and loyalty. The business is highly cash generative.""

Around the same time Mr Issa was being grilled by MPs, Asda announced it had opened a record number of new shops in December. The company launched 81 new Asda Express stores this month.

A SUV ended up on top of a Tesla SUV following a collision on the westbound Queen Elizabeth Way in Burlington late Monday afternoon.

The crash, which also involved a pick-up truck, happened just before 4:30 p.m. near Royal Windsor Drive.

According to Burlington OPP, the driver of the Tesla had pulled over to the left shoulder due to a slowdown ahead.

They said that a SUV was then hit from behind by the driver of a pick-up truck and crashed into that Tesla, somehow landing on top of it.

The pick-up truck driver has since been charged with careless driving.

Which companies have the most employees working on an H-1B visa?,2024-12-31T19:21:23Z,"In helping instigate a heated debate over H-1B visas, Elon Musk is speaking both from personal experience and as a business owner. That's because his company, electric car maker Tesla, is among the U.S. companies that bring thousands of foreign engineers and other skilled workers into the U.S. each year.

After not placing in the top 25 H-1B visa employers in prior years, Tesla now ranks No. 16, according to the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) a nonpartisan think tank focused on trade and immigration issues.

While well behind the likes of technology giants such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft and Google, Tesla in 2024 significantly increased its count of employees hired through the visa program, with its 742 approved H-1B petitions for initial employment more than double the 328 it recorded in 2023, NFAP found. Tesla also had 1,025 H-1B petitions for continuing employment approved in 2024.

""I'm in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B,"" Musk, who early in his career worked in the U.S. on an H-1B visa, posted Friday on his social media site, X. Musk also vowed to ""go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend.""

Musk and his companies certainly aren't alone in using the H-1B program to fill out their employee ranks. The tech industry has long pushed to expand the number H-1B visas granted by the government to bring skilled workers to the U.S. from India, China, Canada, Korea, the Philippines and other countries.

The program is capped at 65,000 news visas each year, although an additional 20,000 can be issued for employees with a master's degree or higher, according to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

Here's a rundown of the top 20 companies as listed by the number of H-1B petitions for initial employment the U.S. approved in fiscal-year 2024, according to NFAP:

Amazon . The e-commerce company had the most approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in 2024, with 3,871. That figure was down from more than 4,000 H-1B visas in 2023 and nearly 6,400 in 2022.

. The e-commerce company had the most approved H-1B petitions for initial employment in 2024, with 3,871. That figure was down from more than 4,000 H-1B visas in 2023 and nearly 6,400 in 2022.

'Never seen anything like this': Elon Musk after Cybertruck blast claims life,2024-12-31T19:00:00Z,"Firefighter vehicles are seen behind yellow tape in a cordoned area, after a Tesla Cybertruck burned at the entrance of Trump Tower, in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. January 1, 2025. — Reuters

A Tesla Cybertruck exploded outside the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas on Wednesday, resulting in one fatality and several injuries, with Tesla CEO Elon Musk expressing his shock over the incident, saying he has never seen anything like this before.

Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill said at a press conference that a person was found dead inside the 2024 model-year Cybertruck and seven people sustained minor injuries from the explosion.

Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, said the electric car maker was investigating the fire.

""The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,"" he said in a post on X, adding, ""We’ve never seen anything like this.""

McMahill said the Cybertruck pulled up to the Trump building at 8:40am. local time. He said police were mindful of the New Orleans attack that had occurred in the early hours of Wednesday. The FBI said a potential explosive device was found in the vehicle used in that attack.

""As you can imagine with an explosion here on iconic Las Vegas Boulevard, we are taking all the precautions that we need to take to keep our community safe. We're looking for secondary devices,"" McMahill said, adding that there did not appear to be any further threat to the community.

Eric Trump, executive vice president of the Trump Organization and a son of president-elect Donald Trump, posted about the incident on X. ""Earlier today, a reported electric vehicle fire occurred in the porte cochère of Trump Las Vegas,"" he wrote.

The US National Transportation Safety Board in 2024 opened an investigation into a crash and fire involving a Tesla electric semi-truck on a California highway.

"Elon Musk's promises for Tesla in 2024, from robotaxis to Optimus bots",2024-12-31T18:09:19Z,"Elon Musk had an eventful 2024, what with his hard push into right-wing politics and leveraging his X social media platform and considerable influence to help Donald Trump win the presidential election.

Putting politics aside for a moment, it’s worth focusing on another Musk pastime: making promises for Tesla.

The Tesla CEO’s promises — and repeated missed deadlines — have become a primary thread in the Tesla storyline. And they’ve always had an eye-popping quality that captured the imagination of investors and helped drive up the value of Tesla stock, giving the company a valuation of $1.3 trillion. There was his claim in 2015 that Tesla vehicles would be self-driving in two years, that cross-country driverless road-trips would be enabled by the end of 2017, and that Tesla owners would be able to earn money via a massive driverless ride-hailing network in 2020.

And while Tesla has cemented its place in history books thanks to building and selling millions of electric vehicles, none of the above promises (nor many others) have come to pass.

But that hasn’t stopped Musk from making more promises in 2024. Here’s an accounting of those promises and when he expects them to become reality.

You can just say things — Kekius Maximus (@elonmusk) December 26, 2024

The $25,000 EV

In 2024 alone, Musk pledged to unveil a $25,000 EV, then scrapped it in April to prioritize a robotaxi prototype — a decision that led to mass layoffs as Tesla pursued its “next phase of growth.”

Musk has flip-flopped on whether the affordable EV would ever come to market. But during Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, Musk said the idea of building a $25,000 car with a steering wheel and pedals is “pointless” and “silly.” He said the only car he’d sell at that price point would be the Cybercab.

During the call, an analyst asked if Tesla would make a lower-cost EV that’s not the Cybercab, and Musk replied that all of the company’s cars moving forward would be autonomous. He also said that of the 7 million vehicles Tesla has built to date, the “vast majority” are “capable of autonomy,” and that Tesla is “currently making on the order of 35,000 autonomous vehicles a week.” Musk is clearly using a loose definition of autonomy here, because Tesla still does not produce vehicles that are safe to use without a human behind the wheel.

(Flashback: Musk originally promised in 2016, in a since-deleted post on Tesla’s website, that “All Tesla Cars Being Produced Now Have Full Self-Driving Hardware,” and that only a software update would be needed to turn regular old Teslas into self-driving cars. That didn’t happen, and Tesla has had to upgrade cars with older hardware.)

It’s also worth noting that during that earnings call, Musk said that he expects vehicle growth to reach 20% to 30% in 2025 due to “lower cost vehicles” and the “advent of autonomy.”

Start production on the Cybercab by 2025 or 2026

Lineup of 20 Cybercabs at Tesla’s ‘We, Robot’ event Image Credits:Tesla

Tesla unveiled 20 Cybercab prototypes at a flashy Hollywood event in October, and Musk took the opportunity to share some plans for the vehicles, as well as Tesla’s so-called Full Self-Driving (FSD) software. FSD is Tesla’s advanced driver assistance system that can perform many automated driving tasks, but still requires a human to remain attentive behind the wheel and take over if needed.

Musk told customers they would be able to one day buy a robotaxi — a two-door, two-seat vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals — for less than $30,000. He also said that the average operating cost of the Cybercab will reduce over time to only $0.20 per mile. And he said Tesla would start production on the purpose-built AVs in 2025 or 2026.

(Flashback: Musk said in 2022 that Tesla would mass-produce robotaxis by 2024. Before that, in 2019, he said that Tesla would have a million robotaxis on roads by 2020. Musk has promised that Tesla would solve full self-driving “next year” since at least 2016.)

A few weeks later, during Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, Musk said Tesla would reach “volume production in ’26,” and that the company was eventually “aiming for at least 2 million units a year of Cybercab.”

Current federal regulations that require vehicles to be built with certain safety standards, like manual human controls, could be roadblocks for Tesla to mass produce its Cybercabs. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recently proposed new rules that would fast-track exemptions for such vehicles, but they would require companies to share more data with the agency, like crash reporting. Today, automakers are required to report crashes when ADAS or autonomous driving tech is engaged.

Musk has railed against the rule before, and President-elect Donald Trump’s transition team is reportedly exploring scrapping it.

Robovan in development

During Tesla’s robotaxi reveal, the company also showed investors a Robovan prototype. At the time Musk didn’t share any concrete plans for the vehicle, but in November he posted on X that the Robovan is in development, along with “some other things.”

(Flashback: In 2016, Musk said Tesla would start building a minibus using the Model X chassis in two to three years.)

“Unsupervised FSD” and autonomous ride-hail in 2025

At the event, Musk also promised that Model 3 and Model Y owners would be able to use an “unsupervised” version of FSD in California and Texas in 2025.

It wasn’t, and still isn’t, clear what Musk meant by “unsupervised” FSD. Today, Tesla’s FSD is still not fully autonomous, and to dispel any confusion, Tesla this year began referring to the software as “supervised FSD.” Removing the supervision could mean that Tesla plans to remove the driver, or it could mean that Tesla plans to offer a Level 3 autonomous system that allows drivers to go hands-off, eyes-off for a portion of their ride.

During Tesla’s third-quarter earnings call, Musk took the promise of unsupervised FSD a step further. He said he hopes to launch a service that will let people hail self-driving Teslas in California and Texas in 2025. He also claimed Tesla had begun testing the service in the Bay Area with employees.

(Context: There are several tiers of permits required to test and deploy autonomous vehicles in California. Tesla has held a permit to test AVs with a safety driver in the front seat since 2015, but the Department of Motor Vehicles told TechCrunch in October that Tesla last reported using that permit in 2019.)

It’s not clear if Tesla plans to launch this ride-hail service with its robotaxis or with existing Tesla Model 3 and Model Y owners. Tesla’s first-quarter earnings presentation included a mock-up of a future Tesla ride-hail app, and the company has for years teased the idea of a ride-hailing network using Teslas that had been updated to drive fully autonomously. The idea is similar to Uber, only Tesla owners would add their properly equipped self-driving vehicles to the automaker’s ride-hailing app to make extra cash when the cars are not in use. Tesla would take 25% to 30% of the revenue.

Finally, during Tesla’s first-quarter earnings call, Musk said Tesla was in talks with a “major automaker” to license FSD, but so far has not announced any such deals.

“Over a thousand Optimus robots working at Tesla” in 2025

Image Credits:Tesla

Musk has made some out-there promises about Optimus, Tesla’s humanoid robot. During Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting, Musk promised that Tesla would move into “limited production” of the Optimus next year, with “over 1,000, or a few thousand, Optimus robots working at Tesla” in 2025. He also said he expects Optimus to be on sale by 2026. In a post on X, the billionaire executive added that he expects to have more Optimus bots available for use by other companies in 2026.

He did not specify if the bots would be working fully autonomously, or if they would be remotely controlled by humans, as they were during Tesla’s robotaxi reveal event in October.

(Context: While humanoid robots are improving to the point of being able to autonomously complete specific tasks, many experts say generalized robotics is still years away due to a lack of training data.)

Aside from manufacturing promises, Musk also predicted that Optimus could one day lift Tesla’s market cap to $25 trillion. That’s roughly seven times the current market caps of Apple and Nvidia. At the end of December, Tesla’s market cap was around $1.42 trillion, which is almost a 160% increase from the $550 billion market cap before Trump won the presidential election.

Tesla stock surge runs up against a potential annual sales drop,2024-12-31T15:22:09Z,"For all the exuberance about Tesla benefiting from Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Wall Street isn’t so sure the carmaker can avoid its first annual sales decline in more than a decade.

Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimate the company may deliver around 510,400 vehicles in the final three months of the year. That would set a new quarterly record for Tesla, but the company would need to sell about 4600 more cars to make good on its forecast for slight growth in 2024.

Tesla stock's bumpy road through 2024 was erased by Musk and Trump's bromance,2024-12-31T10:00:00Z,"In This Story TSLA -13.55%

Tesla (TSLA-13.55% ) began 2024 with a bang.

In January alone, the company was slammed by a recall dealing with an Autopilot glitch, reports about CEO Elon Musk’s troubling drug habits, and increased competition at home and abroad. By February, the stock was down 24%, and it would be stuck as one of the worst performers in the S&P 500 for the first quarter of the year and part of the second as Tesla enacted mass layoffs.

But all those losses have been more than erased. As of Dec. 30, even as Tesla’s value is slowly shedding some gains, the stock is up by more than 70% this year.

Here’s how it got there.

The first major boost to Tesla shares came in April after Musk put off a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to focus on his “very heavy Tesla obligations.” That turned out to be code for a surprise visit to Beijing, where he met with Chinese Premier Li Qiang.

That meeting paved the way for Tesla to chart a path to test its Full Self-Driving technology on state roads. About a month later, the automaker began preparing to register its driver-assist software with China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. Fast-forward another month and Shanghai began allowing Tesla to carry out limited testing of the software, Reuters reported, although FSD has not yet been cleared by regulators.

The next aid to Tesla came not from the company but from its investors.

In June, the vast majority of Tesla shareholders — both institutional and retail investors alike — voted to re-approve Musk’s 2018 compensation package, which gives the CEO the ability to buy up to 304 million Tesla shares at a pre-set price of $23.34. Tesla shares haven’t traded below $100 apiece since August 2020.

The vote was both a vote in favor of compensating Musk, who had technically gone unpaid since the plan was approved half a decade earlier, and a sign of confidence in his vision and importance to Tesla. Ahead of the vote, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm wrote that “motivating someone like Elon requires something different” and that the package would help ensure he doesn’t depart Tesla for “other places.”

“Hot damn, I love you guys,” Musk said on June 13 after taking the stage at the shareholder meeting to a barrage of applause from the crowd.

Unfortunately for Tesla and its investors, the vote did not sway Delaware Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick, who, in January, had shut down Musk’s roughly $56 billion package. After again rejecting the package, McCormick on Dec. 13 opened the 30-day window for Tesla to appeal her ruling to the Delaware Supreme Court.

From June to early November, Tesla stock came crashing back down to Earth as its robotaxi plans and poor second-quarter performance failed to excite investors. Then, Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election.

It’s no secret that Trump and Musk have gotten closer this year; Business Insider reports that Musk’s planes took 31 flights to or from Palm Beach International Airport this year, beginning in February. Trump’s “Winter White House,” Mar-a-Lago, is about five miles from the airport.

The entrepreneur has become an almost constant presence in Trump’s orbit since the election, joining calls and meetings with major CEOs and world leaders. Several of his allies, including Jared Isaacman, David Sacks, and the next head of the Federal Communications Commission, have been selected for roles in the new Trump administration. Musk has also been granted his own task force, nicknamed DOGE, that aims to recommend cuts to federal spending.

The president-elect’s team has reportedly discussed a number of actions that would benefit Musk, including rolling back car-crash reporting rules Tesla opposed and streamlining autonomous vehicle regulations. He may also end the $7,500 consumer tax credits for electric vehicles, a move that would likely hurt Tesla’s sales but has been endorsed by Musk.

Investors’ enthusiasm for Trump and Musk’s bromance pushed the stock to a few all-time highs, including a price of about $470 per share, although those gains have been somewhat shed. Before the election, Tesla shares were trading at about $250 a pop.

Elon Musk's Battle Over H-1B Visa Sparks Controversy and Debate in Tech,2024-12-31T05:26:44Z,"Elon Musk has reignited the debate surrounding the H-1B visa program by calling it 'broken' and in urgent need of 'major reform.' The tech billionaire and Indian-American entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy have been tapped by Donald Trump to lead the Department of Government Efficiency.

Musk, once on an H-1B visa himself, argues for the necessity of foreign workers in tech. He suggests reforms like raising the minimum salary and adding costs to make it more expensive to hire foreign talent. His position has drawn support from Trump, despite past restrictions.

The debate intensified after criticism from right-wing influencers who oppose the influx of skilled immigrants. Vivek Ramaswamy's comments on American culture facing mediocrity also sparked controversy, leading to Musk's call to remove certain elements from the Republican Party.

It appears the lower fog lights will continue to feature on the updated Model Y, despite the Model 3 ditching these units as a part of its Highland facelift.

At the rear, there’s an even clearer indication that the Model Y will get a light bar connecting its rear clusters, which would signal a departure from the previous and existing styling of Tesla’s two most popular EVs.

Only one interior photo has been leaked so far, showing what appears to be perforated leather or leatherette upholstery on the seats, suede-look trim on the door, and a thin strip of ambient lighting.

It’s expected the Model Y will follow the Model 3 by ditching its traditional steering column stalks and adopting controversial steering wheel buttons.

In the Model 3, additional changes included its gear selector being relocated to its touchscreen, its front seats gaining ventilation, and the addition of a rear climate control screen.

Tesla’s updated Model 3 also received revised suspension upgrades including new springs, dampers, and subframe mounting points designed to deliver a more comfortable ride.

In October, reports emerged from China that Shanghai production of the updated Model Y had been pulled forward to start this month, if initially only in low volumes.

Two months have passed and none of these vehicles have surfaced.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously said the Juniper facelift won’t debut until 2025, despite earlier reports claiming it would debut before the end of this year.

The updated Model Y could bring an increase in sales for the electric SUV, which in 2023 was the best-selling vehicle for private buyers in Australia.

While the Model Y remains Australia’s best-selling EV, Tesla is experiencing a sales drop in 2024, with deliveries declining in nine of the 11 months so far this year.

To the end of November, Tesla had delivered 19,932 Model Ys, down almost 30 per cent year-to-date on 2023.

Model 3 deliveries have also fallen by about seven per cent, despite Tesla heavily discounting both EVs by thousands of dollars earlier this year.

Trump calls it the ‘center of the universe.’ Mar-a-Lago is a magnet for those seeking influence.,2024-12-31T05:00:00Z,"Over the weekend, Mike Love, one of the original members of the Beach Boys, performed the band’s greatest hits under an outdoor tent there as Trump, trailed by Secret Service agents, wandered through the crowd, swinging his fists to the music, according to videos posted online. At other parts of the evening, he stood next to his wife, Melania, near the pool, bobbing his head to the music.

Famous figures such as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Tesla and X owner Elon Musk pop up at breakfasts, luncheons and other social gatherings held daily at the opulent Mar-a-Lago club.

PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — The cars begin lining up early in the morning to be screened by Secret Service agents under white tents near the fence that surrounds President-elect Donald Trump’s vast south Florida estate.

The resort is the “Center of the Universe,” Trump declared on social media Friday, adding, ""Bill Gates asked to come, tonight."" Representatives for Trump and Gates didn't clarify if the Microsoft co-founder did indeed join the parade of figures making the trip to Mar-a-Lago.

Get Starting Point A guide through the most important stories of the morning, delivered Monday through Friday. Enter Email Sign Up

But the president-elect's post reflects the way his resort, where he's largely been holed up since the election, has become a salon and celebration for his movement. For the people he's selected for his administration — and those who seek to get jobs or curry favor with the incoming president — it's the place to be.

Sightings of those turning up there, usually in photos posted online or in the occasional public event, offer a glimpse into the workings of Trump’s incoming White House and how he is setting priorities for office.

They are also renewing concerns about transparency as the meetings are largely shrouded in secrecy, and raising questions about how Trump benefits financially as club members seeking to influence the new administration stay and eat there.

“It’s kind of unreal,"" said James Fishback, an investor who has in recent days launched an investment fund in the club’s tea room and dined at the courtyard. “This is the power center.”

He recalled standing by the pasta table exchanging words with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom Trump has chosen to lead the Health Department.

The winter holidays have been another occasion for Trump's celebrations and for big names to come visit.

A representative for Zuckerberg confirmed he joined Trump for a dinner the night before Thanksgiving. A Christmas Eve video showed Trump in one of the resort's ballrooms full of guests, dancing to one of his favorite songs, the Village People's “Y.M.C.A.,” while his daughter Ivanka sat in a gilded chair nearby.

The club held a New Year's Eve bash Tuesday night that featured Trump, who spoke briefly to reporters near a red carpet rolled out for the occasion. He appeared briefly onstage addressing revelers, who included Love and many of his choices for Cabinet and other posts in his upcoming administration.

Trump said he thought 2025 would be a “great year” and “we’re going to do fantastically well as a country.”

During dinners with friends and family, Trump uses the Spotify account on his tablet to play many of the same tunes that were ubiquitous at his campaign rallies. One night, his guest of honor was Sara Netanyahu, the wife of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Another night, the honor went to Akie Abe, the widow of slain Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. And, yes, that was Argentine President Javier Milei doing Trump’s “Y.M.C.A.” dance between the tables at a gala dinner.

During the day, Trump often golfs at his nearby course with friends, relatives and allies, like Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.

Overall, the vibe is a mix of south Florida's monied social scene overlaid with the power dynamics of an executive job fair.

“He’s surrounded by a lot of old friends,” Graham said. “I just know that everybody I know wants some job.”

Musk has been a constant presence at the club, so much so that Trump’s granddaughter, Kai, wrote on X that he was “achieving uncle status.” Trump has tasked Musk and biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy with leading the Department of Government Efficiency, a nongovernmental task force formed to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations.

Kevin Roberts, president of the think tank behind Project 2025, spoke at a December event with investors at the club. One of the guests at the small function was health care executive Dr. Peter Lamelas, later tapped by Trump to be U.S. ambassador to Argentina.

Sometimes Trump relaxes for dinner alongside club members and guests under the yellow and white awnings in the courtyard. Other times, he will address large groups for black-tie events in the ballrooms. At a recent gala for a nonprofit led by Lt. Gen Michael Flynn, the song ″God Bless the U.S.A.,” a favorite of Trump's, cued the president-elect's entrance.

“We’re off to a really good start,” Trump told people gathered for the event. He then inquired about the whereabouts of Tom Homan, whom he has tapped to be border czar, and joked that Homan was from “central casting.”

“Just relax, Tom. I want you to relax and get ready for the big push,” Trump said.

Trump shared with the party guests that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, whom he threatened with a 25% tariff on all imported goods unless she does more to tackle illegal border crossings and drug flows, “has made progress.”

At another recent event at Mar-a-Lago, this one hosted by the America First Policy Institute, the ballroom was full of recognizable Trump-world figures such as Kellyanne Conway, who served as counselor to the president, and Charlie Kirk, a conservative activist and founder of Turning Point Action. A copy of the president-elect’s latest book was sitting on the chairs for guests as they arrived in gowns and tuxedos.

As he entered the ballroom, Musk was swarmed by guests, including Kash Patel, whom Trump would later select to lead the FBI, before the tech billionaire took his seat at the center table of the ballroom. Musk was later joined there by Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance.

“It’s the place to be and the place to be seen,” said Damian Merlo, a political strategist who advises the Salvadoran president, Nayib Bukele. Merlo was at that event as well as another event hosted by the Conservative Political Action Committee.

At a news conference Trump held recently at Mar-a-Lago, the president-elect noted the changed mood compared with his first term, saying, “Everybody wants to be my friend.”

Besides Zuckerberg, Trump has hosted other Silicon Valley executives, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Google co-founder Sergey Brin, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

“The top executives, the top bankers, they’re all calling,” Trump said. “It’s like a complete opposite.”

Actor Russell Brand traveled this month to the club to speak at an event, where he sat with actor Mel Gibson, former Fox News personality Tucker Carlson and others. Later in the evening, he stood by a palm tree on the lawn, listening to a bagpiper in a kilt.

Brand later posted a video to X about his experience.

“Pretty amazing,” he said. “Is this real life, or am I in a dream?”

The Tesla protests are getting bigger - and rowdier,2025-03-10T16:39:09Z,"is a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

This weekend, protests escalated at Tesla showrooms across the nation. Hundreds of people gathered to boycott Elon Musk and his involvement in the Trump administration as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is overseeing a massively disruptive effort to fire thousands of federal workers to slash government spending.

Most of these protests are associated with the Tesla Takedown movement that first emerged in February. It encourages supporters to “sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines” as part of efforts to “stop Musk.” But momentum has ramped up significantly in the past week, leading to bigger turnouts and some arrests.

Here’s a rundown of the biggest protests that happened this weekend.

More than 350 protestors showed up outside the Tesla showroom in Manhattan’s West Village neighborhood on Saturday, chanting things like, “Nobody voted for Elon Musk” and “Oligarchs out, democracy in,” according to reports from Vanity Fair and The New York Times. Another protestor held up a sign saying, “Send Musk to Mars Now!!” This protest coincided with the International Women’s Day march, making it even bigger.

A heavy police presence was in the area, as shown in a TikTok with officers surrounding a Tesla Cybertruck parked on the side of the road. Five protestors were arrested for disorderly conduct, while another was apprehended for resisting arrest, obstruction, and violation of local law, New York Daily News reports.

This follows the arrest of nine people during a Tesla Takedown protest in Manhattan the previous week.

Around 300 demonstrators rallied outside a Tesla showroom on Boston’s Boylston Street, as reported by local news station WCVB. The group also staged a flash mob in front of the dealership, according to The Boston Globe.

“We are not condoning property damage for sure, but Elon should keep in mind that if he wants to attack the basic rights, the basic well-being of regular people, he shouldn’t be surprised when some people decide to be more direct about it,” Shua Sanchez, a rally organizer, told WCVB.

No arrests were made during the protest.

Chicago

Hundreds of protestors stood outside the Streeterville Tesla showroom on Saturday, which was joined by marchers from the Women’s Day march, Block Club Chicago and the Chicago Tribune report. Protestors held similar signs, like “Launch Musk to Mars” and “Democracy Dies with DOGE.”

Meanwhile, protestors at the Tesla showroom in Chicago’s Orland Park clashed with supporters of the MAGA movement, according to the Chicago Tribune. There were no reports of arrests at either demonstration.

Delray Beach

There were also dozens of Tesla Takedown protestors at Musk’s Delray Beach, Florida dealership, with demonstrators holding signs like “Fight fascism,” “Democracy is not a business plan,” and “No one voted for Elon Musk!!” CBS 12 reports.

“We’re here today rallying against Elon and what he’s done,” one protestor, Jeff Finkelstein, told CBS 12. “Ever since Trump’s been in it’s been more about Musk than Trump and we’re just showing our frustration.”

Pasadena

On the West Coast, hundreds of protestors stood in front of Tesla’s Old Pasadena dealership in California. Rep. Judy Chu (D-CA) made an appearance during the event, where she criticized Musk’s DOGE initiative and President Donald Trump.

“He [Trump] said that firing American federal workers would be making America better,” Chu said, according to Pasadena Now. “No. Instead, he has fired thousands of workers from the National Weather Service, which we rely on to tell us if there’s a dangerous weather event.”

This is the second weekend in a row that demonstrators gathered outside the Pasadena dealership.

Portugal

Tesla protests are even popping up outside of the US, with dozens of people in Lisbon, Portugal, holding signs that said “Boycott Tesla” outside a Tesla dealership, Reuters reports. This demonstration occurred on Sunday, just before what could be the country’s third parliamentary election in three years.

As noted by Reuters, the protestors raised concerns about Musk’s promotion of right-wing politics in Europe. One protestor told the outlet that Musk “may not be able to have enough influence in the next election in Portugal but with the amount of money he has, step by step, he can do that.”

How has this affected Tesla?

Even before the protests started, Tesla’s sales dropped year over year for the first time. Some drivers have also decided to trade in or sell their Teslas to avoid embarrassment, with one owner telling The New York Times she was called a “Nazi.” Tesla’s stock price has also plummeted more than 50 percent from its record high in December, Forbes reports, while Musk’s net worth sunk from $464 billion in December to $330 billion.",https://www.theverge.com/news/626851/tesla-takedown-protests-elon-musk
Tesla’s stock defied gravity for years. Is Elon Musk’s EV party over?,2025-03-10T10:06:13Z,"Tesla’s (TSLA-Q) stock has dropped by nearly half in three months. Even so, investors are still debating whether Elon Musk’s electric-vehicle maker remains overpriced.

The company’s market capitalization has dropped 45% since hitting an all-time high of $1.5 trillion on December 17, erasing most of the gains the stock made after CEO Musk helped finance the election victory of U.S. President Donald Trump.

And yet Tesla continues to fetch a valuation far above those of the world’s biggest automotive and technology firms, judging by standard financial metrics. That’s because most investors and analysts have bought Musk’s pitch that the world’s most-valuable automaker isn’t really a car company at all, but rather an artificial-intelligence pioneer that will soon unleash a revolution in robotaxis and humanoid robots.

Tesla’s electric-vehicle business accounts for almost all of its revenue but less than a quarter of its stock-market value, according to a Reuters review of more than a dozen analyzes by banks and investment firms. The bulk of its worth rests on hopes for autonomous vehicles Tesla hasn’t yet delivered, despite Musk’s promises in every year since 2016 that driverless Teslas would arrive no later than the following year.

The stock’s decline since December stems from falling vehicle sales and profits; protests of Musk’s political activity, including his mass firings of U.S. government workers as a senior Trump advisor; and investor worries that politics are distracting the world’s richest man from tending to his cash cow. Still, Tesla’s market capitalization remains up about $65 billion since the election – an amount higher than the entire value of General Motors.

Tesla’s total worth of $845 billion still tops the next nine most-valuable major automakers combined, which collectively sold about 44 million cars last year, compared to Tesla’s 1.8 million.

Investors have long bet on Musk’s visions of Tesla’s tomorrow rather than its profits today. But the widening gap between its real-world performance and analysts’ earnings estimates for unborn products has prompted some to warn of irrational exuberance.

“For how much longer can the stock remain divorced from the fundamentals?” JP Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in January, after Tesla reported poor earnings and its first-ever annual vehicle-sales decline.

Tesla and Musk did not respond to requests for comment. In July, Musk said investors who don’t believe Tesla would “solve vehicle autonomy” should “sell their Tesla stock.”

After this article was published on Monday morning, Tesla shares fell by more than 8% by mid-day after UBS cut its forecast for the automaker’s first-quarter deliveries. The decline came amid a broader market selloff on worries about tariffs and recession fears. The Nasdaq was down by about 3% and the S&P 500 was down about 2%.

Tesla’s previous peak value of more than $1.2 trillion came in 2021, in response to concrete achievements. Soaring sales of its ground-breaking Model 3 and Model Y had proved that EVs could sell profitably in mass volumes. Musk vowed then that Tesla would produce even cheaper EVs and sell 20 million vehicles annually by 2030, nearly double what the world’s largest automaker, Toyota, sells now.

Musk, however, shifted from the mass-volume goal last year. In April, Reuters reported Tesla had killed a long-awaited, all-new $25,000 “Model 2″ that investors had counted on to drive growth. Since then, Musk has pitched investors on Tesla’s robotaxi focus.

The pivot was persuasive: Tesla shares jumped 71% from last year’s low in April through the November election, even as its EV sales stalled and profits fell.

Then the stock nearly doubled in the weeks after Trump’s election. Musk spent more than $250 million supporting Trump and now serves as his top advisor on slashing government staff and regulations.

Musk’s political clout has convinced bullish analysts that Trump will clear regulatory roadblocks to deploying a vast fleet of Tesla robotaxis. Tesla, however, already faces little oversight from many U.S. states, which control most autonomous-vehicle regulation. Texas, where Musk promises to launch fare-collecting robotaxis by June, has barred cities from regulating them.

“There’s absolutely nothing stopping him from releasing this self-driving technology right now,” said Gordon Johnson, chief executive of investment-advisory firm GLJ Research, which recommends shorting Tesla’s stock. The tech isn’t road-ready, Johnson argues: “If he released it tomorrow, the jig would be up. These things would be wrecking across America.”

Tesla has faced lawsuits and federal investigations into accidents, including fatalities, involving the driver-assistance systems it has marketed as Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. The company warns consumers the systems don’t make its cars autonomous and require drivers to pay strict attention. Musk has long said Tesla’s technology will soon be safer than a human driver.

The automaker’s core EV business is struggling. The only vehicle Tesla has launched since the 2020 Model Y is the Cybertruck. The triangular pickup had sales of 38,965 units last year, Cox Automotive estimates, well below the 250,000 that Musk initially predicted Tesla would produce by 2025. Tesla has also cut prices on the now-aging models 3 and Y amid slowing electric-vehicle demand globally and rising competition, especially in China, where EVs start below $10,000.

New data also show sharp Tesla-sales declines this year in European markets following Musk’s embrace of far-right political movements there.

Tesla now faces headwinds from the president Musk helped elect. Trump, a frequent EV critic, has called for scrapping EV subsidies and policies that have added billions of dollars to Tesla’s bottom line. Musk has dismissed the impact on Tesla of losing subsidies, saying rivals would suffer more.

When Tesla reported a 20% drop in annual operating profit in January, analysts on the earnings call asked no questions about Tesla’s financials or falling EV sales. They focused instead on Musk’s promises of “autonomous ride-hailing” in Austin, Texas, by June and a wider driverless-vehicle launch by year-end. Tesla shares rose 3% the next day.

Tesla still trades at huge premiums, as measured by forward price-to-earnings ratios. The measure is used by investors to judge whether stocks are fairly valued. A high ratio suggests shares might be overpriced.

Tesla’s forward PE ratio is more than nine times the average of the next 25 most-valuable automakers. It’s quadruple that of BYD, the Chinese automaker that passed Tesla last year as the world’s top EV seller.

Unlike Tesla, BYD also has a booming business in gas-electric hybrids, driving total 2024 sales to about 4.2 million units, more than double Tesla’s deliveries. Yet BYD’s market capitalization is less than a sixth of Tesla’s.

Tesla’s forward PE ratio also is more than double or triple those of tech giants Nvidia, Apple, Meta Platforms, Alphabet, Amazon.com and Microsoft — the other six high-flying stocks, along with Tesla, known as the Magnificent Seven.

Bulls discount standard financial metrics for judging Tesla’s potential, arguing Musk is singularly capable of leading a transportation revolution. He has said robotaxis and robots will make Tesla the “most valuable company in the world by far.”

Brian Mulberry, client-portfolio manager at Tesla investor Zacks Investment Management, said Musk “always pulls off the technology,” despite long-running concerns about his “mad-scientist personality.”

Most analyst models reviewed by Reuters remain bullish.

Such models typically justify Tesla’s market value by breaking it into several categories: Its auto business, including services such as EV charging (now 90% of revenue); its energy-generation and storage business (10% of revenue); and three embryonic businesses: robotaxis; licensing or subscriptions for self-driving technology; and Optimus humanoid robots. Three such models in January rated EV sales as a relatively minor factor in Tesla’s expected growth.

Truist Securities attributed just 9% of Tesla’s value to car sales, 21% to driverless-tech services, 17% to robotaxis and 34% to robots.

Bank of America’s model attributes about half of Tesla’s value to robotaxis and 28% to self-driving software subscriptions.

Morgan Stanley attributes 21% to robotaxis and 39% to subscriptions for autonomous-tech and other services.

Tesla investor Ark Investment Management projects the stock will hit $2,600 by 2029, with robotaxis accounting for 88% of the company’s value. Ark forecasts Tesla could produce millions of robotaxis by then, generating about $760 billion in annual revenue. That would be more than Walmart, the world’s largest company by revenue.

Tasha Keeney, Ark’s director of investment analysis and institutional strategies, said she believes Tesla will achieve such growth by slashing the cost-per-mile of ride-hailing, making human drivers obsolete.

“It’s cheaper than driving your personal car,” she said. “Maybe people will stop even driving.”

Trump could potentially clear the path for driverless cars with no steering wheels or pedals because the federal government regulates the safety of vehicle designs. Musk last October unveiled a concept car with such a configuration, the two-door Cybercab, saying it would go into production in 2026.

But individual states govern autonomous-vehicle travel on public roads, limiting Trump’s influence. Some states, including Texas, have few rules. Tesla’s largest U.S. market, California, requires extensive driverless testing under state oversight before granting robotaxi permits.

A Trump move to loosen robotaxi regulation could benefit all competitors, not just Tesla. The tiny U.S. robotaxi industry, for now, is dominated by Alphabet’s Waymo, which operates hundreds of driverless taxis in cities including Los Angeles and Phoenix.

Waymo and most other autonomous-tech developers seek to ensure safety with many overlapping technologies, including artificial intelligence, radar and lidar. Tesla aims to develop much cheaper robotaxis by relying solely on cameras and AI.

Some investors doubt Tesla has found a unique path to cut-rate robotaxis. Mark Spiegel, an investment manager at Stanphyl Capital Partners, is shorting Tesla’s stock, an investment that pays off if shares fall.

Tesla’s approach to robotaxis “does not work safely and never will without radar and lidar,” Spiegel said.

And China’s BYD said last month it would offer — for free, as a standard feature — a driver-assistance technology similar to the Full Self-Driving system that Tesla sells in China for more than $8,000.

“BYD is telling you there’s no value in self-driving,” said Johnson, the GLJ Research analyst. “In fact, it’s so valueless that we’ll give it away.”

"Borderlands Mexico: Cartels a barrier to growing cross-border trade, expert says",2025-03-09T11:00:00Z,"An international trade expert sees promise in Mexico’s approach to enhancing trade but says organized crime remains an obstacle.

On Jan. 13, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum unveiled Plan Mexico, an ambitious initiative aimed at ultimately lifting her country from 12th place to among the top 10 economies in the world.

Plan Mexico includes a portfolio of $277 billion in national and foreign investments to be distributed across 2,000 projects in sectors such as the automotive, pharmaceutical, aerospace, agribusiness, electromobility and textile industries.

The initiative also includes increasing Mexico’s share in global exports to 15%, reducing the time to approve investment projects in the country from 2.6 years to one year and solidifying the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement to help North America compete against China.

Jorge Gonzalez Henrichsen, co-CEO of The Nearshore Co., praised the plan as a step in the right direction for trade across North America but said it fails to address the issue of organized crime in Mexico.

“Plan Mexico has positive initiatives, good initiatives. I’m glad that the government is looking at this, but some questions are how it is going to be executed,” Henrichsen told FreightWaves in an interview. “One thing that I was surprised that the Mexico plan does not talk about, or at least it doesn’t seem to be addressing, is the cartel issue, which is really the elephant in the room.”

The Nearshore Co., based in Brownsville, Texas, is an international trade and development firm that helps companies set up shelter operations in Mexico.

A trade spat between the U.S., Canada, Mexico and China has emerged in the past several weeks over President Donald Trump’s use of tariffs against those countries as a way to hold them accountable for what he said is the growing flow of fentanyl and illegal immigrants across U.S. borders.





The Trump administration hit imports from Canada and Mexico with 25% tariffs at midnight on Tuesday, alongside an additional 10% tariff on goods from China imposed Monday.

On Thursday, Trump paused the 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico until April 2.

“We’re talking about tariffs, but everything you read and hear from the politicians is this link between the tariffs to the cartels. The cartels are actually involved in both issues that the Trump administration keeps talking about, which is fentanyl, the drug trade, and in the immigration issue,” Henrichsen said. “In my view, for nearshoring in Mexico to take off as we all once imagined it would, if we want to improve [Mexico’s] chances of this being a success story for the next decades, we need to address the things that are in the Plan Mexico, plus the cartel situation.”

The U.S. and Mexico have cooperated in the past to curb cartel crimes, including the Mérida Initiative, according to the Council on Foreign Relations, a Washington-based think tank.

“In 2008, the United States and Mexico began implementing the Mérida Initiative, a counternarcotics cooperation framework that provides Mexico roughly $400 million a year in assistance, including military aircraft, surveillance software, and airport inspection equipment. Meanwhile, drug-related killings soar; in 2009 alone, more than 9,600 people are killed in connection with organized crime,” the Council on Foreign Relations said in a report.

In 2023, President Joe Biden and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador agreed to boost bilateral efforts to curb manufacturing and distribution of fentanyl.

“The two leaders also discuss how to manage the nearly 2.5 million irregular border encounters recorded in fiscal year 2023, the most on record,” the Council on Foreign Relations said.

In recent weeks, Mexican authorities have made some moves to crack down on illegal border crossings and curb organized crime in the country.





Mexico began using members of its Army at border crossings in Laredo and Pharr, Texas, to inspect cargo trucks and passenger vehicles before they enter the United States.

Last week, Mexican authorities sent 29 drug cartel figures, including a man involved in the 1985 killing of a Drug Enforcement Administration agent, to the U.S., The Associated Press reported.

U.S. Border Patrol recorded about 8,450 apprehensions of migrants who crossed into the country unlawfully along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to preliminary government data obtained by CBS News.

February’s total could be the lowest monthly apprehensions recorded by border agents since at least fiscal year 2000.

Henrichsen said if Mexico can clamp down on organized crime and make good on other initiatives as part of Plan Mexico, it would improve foreign investment opportunities, not just in Mexico, but across North America.

“Companies do call us and they are interested in Mexico,” Henrichsen said. “They say, ‘I want to try putting a business there, but I want to try it with you as a local partner, because I’ve never run a facility there.’”

Henrichsen said his firm recently talked to a company that has operations in China that is seeking to diversify its supply chain because of geopolitical uncertainties around the world.

“They have already opened another operation in Vietnam, and they have an operation in the U.S., in Texas, and they want to be diversified between several countries. This is an example of a company that is looking to structure their supply chain for the next 20 years,” Henrichsen said.

Tesla plans to build massive battery plant in Texas

Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) plans to build a battery factory and storage facility near Houston, according to Electrek.

Austin, Texas-based Tesla will take over a 1 million-square-foot building that it already held the lease on at Empire West industrial park near Brookshire, about 40 miles west of downtown Houston.

The facility had previously been occupied by freight forwarder DB Schenker, where it handled parts deliveries for Tesla in the region.

The Tesla factory will build megapack batteries, along with large-scale energy storage systems for solar and other renewable energy projects.

The factory could employ as many as 1,500 workers by 2028. Tesla did not disclose the timeline for the factory, but a tax abatement agreement with Waller County starts in 2026.

Logistics firm opens second supply chain facility in Austin, Texas

RK Logistics Group opened its second facility in Austin, Texas, aimed at providing supply chain management solutions for semiconductor, automotive and lithium-ion battery companies.

The 84,000-square-foot logistics center is in north Austin at 2120 Grand Avenue Parkway. The 15-dock-door temperature-controlled warehouse provides secured storage, inventory management, order assembly and kitting, order fulfillment, and expedited and dedicated transportation solutions, according to a news release.

In 2023, RK Logistics opened a 200,000-square-foot warehousing and distribution center in Kyle, about 20 miles south of Austin.

RK Logistics Group, based in Fremont, California, is a 3PL that targets high-tech companies. The company has 17 facilities in five states totaling 1.7 million square feet of warehouse space.

Authorities seize $4M in drugs hidden in blueberry shipment

Law enforcement in South Texas recently discovered 1,500 pounds of methamphetamine concealed in pallets containing blueberries from Mexico, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

The Pharr Police Department contacted the DEA on Tuesday with information that pallets containing methamphetamine were at a distribution warehouse in Pharr, Texas, Eric Castaneda, assistant special agent with the DEA, told KRGV.

Police worked with the DEA to seize the drugs. The load containing the blueberries originated in the Mexican state of Michoacan and was destined for Atlanta, Castaneda said.

Authorities did not say if any arrests were made when the methamphetamine was seized. The drugs had a street value of $4.8 million.

Tesla shares hurt by political backlash and bursting of the ‘bro bubble’,2025-03-09T06:00:00Z,"Elon Musk’s flirtation with far-right politics continues to hurt Tesla, with deliveries in what was its biggest European market – Germany – down 70 per cent.

Is Tesla’s darkening outlook fully priced into shares?

Bulls might hope so, given shares are down more than 30 per cent in 2025 and by some 45 per cent since December’s peak. However, that may be optimistic.

Yes, shares have tanked, but they have merely retreated to where they were before November’s presidential election. Donald Trump’s victory ignited what Bank of America calls a “bro bubble”, with cryptocurrencies and shares in speculative stocks such as Tesla and Palantir soaring. That bubble has burst.

Arguably, the market is purging the “bro bubble” premium, rather than solely reacting to Tesla’s recent sales woes. Then again, Tesla shares have long been driven by sentiment and narrative, not fundamentals.

Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas has a bullish $430 price target for Tesla. Tesla’s car business accounts for only $86 of this price target, with Jonas more interested in Tesla’s forays into AI, robotics, and how many autonomous taxis Tesla will have on the road in – wait for it – 2040.

Tesla’s Entry Into India

Tesla, the global leader in electric vehicles, is all set to open its first showroom in India. The location for this highly anticipated showroom has been confirmed in Mumbai, Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC). Tesla has reportedly signed a five-year lease starting February 2025, with the showroom covering over 4,000 square feet of space.

This showroom marks Tesla’s first retail footprint in India, and while the official launch date is still to be confirmed, it’s expected that Tesla will begin operations in the country by April 2025. This move comes after years of delays due to regulatory hurdles, high import taxes, and the search for a local manufacturing base.

This development follows Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s recent meeting with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, signaling the company’s commitment to the Indian market. Additionally, Tesla is exploring a second showroom location in New Delhi’s Aerocity.

India’s EV Segment: All You Need To Know

While Tesla’s arrival is exciting, the EV future in India looks incredibly promising on a broader scale. Here’s how the country is making strides in EV adoption, the role of the government, and the challenges ahead.

Government Initiatives and Policies

The Indian government is a key player in boosting Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption. Key initiatives include:

FAME Scheme: The Indian government’s Faster Adoption and Manufacturing of Hybrid and Electric Vehicles (FAME) scheme has been instrumental in promoting EV adoption. Launched in 2015, FAME I provided incentives for 278,000 EVs with an outlay of Rs 895 crore. FAME II, introduced in 2019 with a budget of Rs 10,000 crore, has supported 6315 electric buses and thousands of charging stations, as per a report by Deloitte.

With the growth of the EV market, there will be a push for bi-directional chargers. Bi-directional chargers will enable active management of charging and allow EVs to participate in the power market.

Tesla’s Impact On India’s EV Market

Tesla’s entry is anticipated to invigorate India’s EV sector. The company plans to introduce models starting at Rs 21 lakh, aiming to attract a segment of Indian consumers. However, the majority of EV sales in India currently occur in the sub-Rs 15 lakh category, dominated by local manufacturers like Tata Motors and Mahindra. This pricing disparity suggests that while Tesla’s presence will enhance consumer interest in EVs, it may not immediately disrupt the existing market dynamics.

Challenges: What’s Holding India Back?

"‘Takedown Tesla’ event in downtown Chicago to protest Musk, Trump",2025-03-08T23:42:56Z,"Hundreds of people gathered downtown Saturday afternoon to protest President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s government spending cuts, carrying signs that read “Launch Musk to Mars” and “Democracy Dies with DOGE.”

Protesters marched down Michigan Avenue and past a Tesla dealership in Streeterville, chanting “Elon Musk has got to go.” Indivisible Chicago, a volunteer-led progressive activist group, organized the “Takedown Tesla” protest. Musk is the CEO and a co-founder of the electric car company.

“We are really upset about what the current Trump administration is doing, and we are really upset about what Musk is being allowed to do,” said Denise Poloyac, a board member of Indivisible Chicago. “They’re threatening our democracy. They’re stealing from us, and we are out here to express how angry we are at that.”

Critics of Trump and Musk hope to discourage and stigmatize purchases of vehicles from Tesla, the world’s most valuable automaker. For weeks, liberal groups have organized anti-Tesla protests in cities across the country in hopes of galvanizing opposition to Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency and energizing Democrats still demoralized by Trump’s November election victory.

Musk’s DOGE has shrunk the federal government’s workforce by the thousands and has enacted changes seemingly designed to increase political control over agencies that have historically operated with some degree of autonomy.

While some Republicans believe the cuts resonate with voters, Poloyac thinks Musk is undermining “everything that is valuable in this country.”

“He’s eliminating vital services that we all need and expect from our federal government, whether it’s protecting our environment or protecting our public health,” Poloyac said. “Ultimately, he’s using it to enrich himself and his cronies.”

Demonstrations opposing Trump’s administration have picked up across the city recently, including a rally in support of Ukraine and another for democracy. There was a separate rally and march Saturday morning at Daley Plaza for International Women’s Day.

Katie Conley, a 32-year-old Evanston resident, carried a sign at Saturday’s protest that said “My Body My Choice” and “Trans Rights are Human Rights.” She said she’s felt “powerless” since Trump took office and wanted to get more involved in protesting his policies.

“Something that really scares me is just how polarized and divided the nation has become,” she said. “I think that we’ve forgotten how to have a conversation and how to hear each other. United we stand, divided we fall.”

Elon Musk protestors clash with cops in chaotic scenes after occupying Tesla showroom,2025-03-08T18:59:45Z,"Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info

A Tesla dealership has been mobbed by protesters in Manhattan following a number of demonstrations against Elon Musk and US President Donald Trump.

It follows demonstrators gathering outside Tesla stores across the US earlier this month in protest against Musk and his push to slash government spending on behalf of Trump. Critics of Trump and Musk hope to discourage and stigmatise purchases of Tesla, the electric car company that is the world's most valuable automaker and have taken issue with Musk's disruptive role in Washington.

We can get back at Elon,"" said Nathan Phillips, a 58-year-old ecologist from Newton, Massachusetts, who was protesting in Boston on March 1. ""We can impose direct economic damage on Tesla by showing up at showrooms everywhere and boycotting Tesla and telling everyone else to get out, sell your stocks, sell your Teslas.""

Musk is head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), tasked with slashing federal spending. The role has been controversial and DOGE's work during the early stages of the Trump administration has drawn nearly two dozen lawsuits.

Musk, Trump and allies argue that victory in the presidential election gave Trump a mandate to restructure the US government. But DOGE officials have swiftly gained access to sensitive databases, directed thousands of federal job cuts, cancelled contracts and shut down sections of the government, including the US Agency for International Development.

Judges have raised questions in several cases about DOGE's sweeping cost-cutting efforts, conducted with little public information about its staffing and operations. But judges have not always agreed that the risks are imminent enough to block DOGE from government systems.

""Protests will not deter President Trump and Elon Musk from delivering on the promise to establish Doge and make our federal government more efficient and more accountable to the hardworking American taxpayers across the country,"" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said previously.

‘Major brand worries’: Just how toxic is Elon Musk for Tesla?,2025-03-08T13:00:23Z,"Globally renowned brands would not, ordinarily, want to be associated with Germany’s far-right opposition. But Tesla, one of the world’s biggest corporate names, does not have a conventional chief executive.

After Elon Musk backed Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) – calling the party Germany’s “only hope” – voters are considering an alternative to Tesla. Data released on Thursday showed that registrations of the company’s electric cars in Germany fell 76% to 1,429 last month. Overall, electric vehicle registrations rose by 31%.

Tesla’s biggest shareholder, who has voiced support for rightwing leaders around the world, is now a de facto US cabinet member under Donald Trump’s administration.

Tesla’s valuation has become inextricably tied to Musk’s politics. After he spent $288m backing Trump’s 2024 election victory, Tesla’s valuation passed $1tn. Yet Musk’s political involvements – unprecedented for the head of a company that size – could also be having a negative effect.

On Friday, a group of Extinction Rebellion activists occupied a Tesla store in central Milan. Activists chained themselves to the cars’ tyres, and others glued themselves to the windows along with the slogans “Make millionaires pay again” and “Ecology for all, no ecofascism”.

Analysts are openly wondering if Musk is causing lasting damage to a brand he has made synonymous with electric cars and, by extension, liberal aspirations to tackle climate change.

Tesla was approached for comment.

Tesla was the world’s biggest producer of battery electric cars in 2024, but sales dropped to 1.79m, the first time the company has endured a sales decline since 2011 after years of rapid growth that made it the world’s most valuable carmaker.

The manufacturer said in January that global sales would grow during 2025, and Wall Street analysts expect Tesla to sell more than 2m cars this year. But even those forecasts would hardly represent a blazing return to form. As recently as October, Musk said he expected 20% to 30% annual sales growth, implying as many as 2.3m cars sold.

“Customer retention will be key in 2025 as customers may begin to look for an ‘Alternative for Tesla’,” said Matthias Schmidt, a Berlin-based electric car analyst.

Other analysts are more optimistic. Dan Ives, of Wedbush Securities, a US financial firm, is a longstanding Tesla supporter. Ives believes the company’s share price could rise from its current level of about $280 to hit $550. However, he acknowledged the negative perception created by Musk’s partnership with Trump and his work on the so-called department of government efficiency (Doge) – an issue he described as the “elephant in the room” for the brand.

Calling them “major brand worries for Tesla”, he added in a note to investors that the direct impact on sales should be relatively small. “We estimate less than 5% of Tesla sales globally are at risk from these issues despite the global draconian narrative for Musk.”

Ives said that Tesla was on the verge of making a new, cheaper vehicle – costing less than $35,000 – and would “own” the autonomous vehicle market, factors that would help push Tesla to a valuation of more than $2tn.

Nonetheless there are clear signs in the US, Tesla’s biggest market, that would-be buyers are wavering, according to Strategic Vision, a market research company. Its new vehicle experience study tracks the buying preferences of up to 250,000 car buyers in the US, and it shows a sharp decline in regard for Tesla since Musk bought Twitter (now X) in 2022.

Shortly before the multibillionaire bought the social media platform, 22% of new vehicle buyers would have “definitely” considered buying a Tesla. By the end of 2024 it was just under 8%. The proportion who would not consider buying a Tesla has risen from 39% over the same period to 63%.

According to Strategic Vision, approximately half of non-Tesla EV buyers identify as Democrat or liberal, compared with about 20% identifying as Republican or conservative. Among Tesla owners, the Democrat owner group has fallen from 40% during the Biden administration to 29% now, with the Republican group averaging about 30% since 2021.

“Democrats, the majority party of EV owners, are now actively rejecting Tesla and choosing other options,” said Alexander Edwards, president of Strategic Vision.

Meanwhile, global protests against Musk and Tesla are intensifying. In America, there have been demonstrations outside dozens of Tesla showrooms, while in the UK a guerrilla poster campaign – “0 to 1939 in 3 seconds” – has emphasised Musk’s fascist-style salute at an inauguration rally. In Germany, he was recently caricatured on a carnival float as “Napo-Elon”.

Ross Gerber, chief executive of the US investment management firm Gerber Kawasaki, which holds shares in Tesla, said Musk had given people an outlet to express their disdain for his politics.

He said: “He has left himself open to a direct way for people to attack him if they don’t like his politics. It’s ironic because the vehicles were made for liberals who care about the environment and it has become a symbol of the conservative movement.”

Tesla is valued at about $847bn – still more than the next 10 carmakers combined. Few investment banks have included any effect from Musk in their work trying to accurately value Tesla. Still, there are further reports of falling sales. In Australia, February sales were down about 72% compared with the same month in 2024, according to data released this week.

Several analysts have raised concerns that the current valuation is much too high. JP Morgan is among the most pessimistic of the investment banks, suggesting that Tesla’s share price could fall as low as $135 – or a valuation closer to $400bn. Musk is the largest shareholder in Tesla, a key contributor to his status as the world’s wealthiest person.

“Tesla shares continue to strike us as having become completely divorced from the fundamentals,” wrote JP Morgan in January, pointing out that 2025 profit expectations were down 70% since 2022. The share price has more than doubled since then – something that would not usually happen when investors expect lower profits.

Analysts at UBS, a Swiss investment bank, concur, saying that Tesla’s valuation “continues to confound us”, with big risks in its efforts to make money from self-driving cars or humanoid robots.

While sales declined steeply in January in several markets, several analysts have warned against relying on numbers for a single month. Schmidt said: “Some consumers are likely holding back purchase decisions and waiting for the updated Model Y which arrives this month. The big question though is, are these just the die-hard Tesla enthusiasts which remain in line while other potential consumers jump ship?”

There have also been positive signs elsewhere. UK Tesla sales fell in January, but bounced back by a fifth in February to leave sales up year-on-year for 2025 so far. In the US there were also signs of a recovery after a fall in January, with preliminary data for February indicating rebound sales of about 42,000 cars, up 14% year-on-year, according to Wards Intelligence.

But the UK sales figures also highlight another concern for investors: that Tesla’s lead on rivals could be narrowing as a flood of new models arrive. Tesla’s electric market share for the first two months of 2025 was 11%, down from 14% in 2024, according to New Automotive, a research group.

Ben Nelmes, New Automotive’s chief executive, said: “The impact of Elon Musk’s political views on Tesla’s sales may have been overstated, but Tesla is gradually losing its position as the dominant EV seller in the UK as other carmakers bring more up-to-date and cheaper models to market.”

In China Tesla is under big pressure from a slew of cheaper competitors, most notably BYD. In Tesla’s second-biggest market, sales of its China-made EVs dropped 49% year-on-year in February, to the lowest level since August 2022.

Edward Niedermeyer, author of Ludicrous – a 2019 book about Tesla which focuses on Musk’s habit of making bold claims about the business that don’t stack up – argues that the prospect for new business like robotaxis and robots are distant. “The unique moment that we’re in now is the business has peaked,” he said.

The worry for Tesla investors is whether Musk has turned that peak into a cliff-edge.
