Amazon Is Preparing Flying 'Prime Air' Drones To Deliver Packages In 30 Minutes Or Less,2013-12-02T14:56:00Z,URL skipped due to domain: https://www.androidpolice.com/2013/12/02/amazon-is-preparing-flying-prime-air-drones-to-deliver-packages-in-30-minutes-or-less/,https://www.androidpolice.com/2013/12/02/amazon-is-preparing-flying-prime-air-drones-to-deliver-packages-in-30-minutes-or-less/
Delivery drones are coming: Jeff Bezos promises half-hour shipping with Amazon Prime Air,2013-12-02T01:10:37Z,"Jeff Bezos is nothing if not a showman. Amazon’s CEO loves a good reveal, and took the opportunity afforded by a 60 Minutes segment to show off his company’s latest creation: drones that can deliver packages up to 5 pounds to your house in less than half an hour. They’re technically octocopters, as part of a program called “Amazon Prime Air.”

A drone sits at the end of a conveyer belt, waiting to pick up a package — Bezos says 86 percent of Amazon’s packages are under 5 pounds — and can carry them up to 10 miles from the fulfillment center. As soon as Amazon can work out the regulations and figure out how to prevent your packages from being dropped on your head from above, Bezos promised, there will be a fleet of shipping drones taking the sky.

The segment focused primarily on holiday shopping, particularly the annual shopping extravaganza that is Cyber Monday. It’s a huge day for Amazon — more than 300 items will be ordered each second — and does much to reveal the company’s true ambitions. Amazon doesn’t just want to reinvent the way we shop for and buy things, it wants to upend every step of the process — including how our purchases come to us.

Charlie Rose spoke to a number of Amazon executives and employees, and toured one of the company's 96 massive warehouses, known as ""fulfillment centers."" Its burgeoning same-day delivery infrastructure was on full display and Rose explored the company's sprawling moves into fashion, groceries, web hosting, tablets, and strange political shows starring John Goodman.

""We like to pioneer, we like to explore. We like to go down dark alleys and find out what's on the other side.""

But Jeff Bezos was predictably the star of the segment. He talked about how, 18 years ago, he’d drive packages to the post office himself and dreamed of one day owning a forklift. (Things have changed a bit since then.) He says we’re four or five years from drones being able to deliver small packages right to your house, largely because the company has to work with the FAA to make sure it’s legally allowed to run the Prime Air program — Amazon doesn’t have Zookal’s luxury of operating in Australia without the FAA’s regulatory oversight.

Bezos knows there’s work to do, but his overwhelming message was simple: get ready. “It will work, and it will happen, and it’s going to be a lot of fun.”",https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/1/5164340/delivery-drones-are-coming-jeff-bezos-previews-half-hour-shipping

New for obsessive pet owners: A wooden box to keep your cat’s whiskers and teeth in!,2014-05-17T04:30:06Z,"Cat owners concerned that they might suddenly forget the existence of their pet or who wish to gross out potential lovers may be pleased to hear of the arrival of two new products on Amazon Japan. The “Cat Whisker Case” and “Cat Milk Tooth Case“, which retail for 1,580 yen (US$16) each, are the perfect way to commemorate your pet’s growth into adulthood and treat them as a true member of the family.

That’s right, you too can have a small box full of cat teeth or whiskers on your dressing table or mantlepiece, just waiting for some hapless visitor to stumble upon before suddenly remembering that they’ve left the oven on at home and have to leave.

The idea behind these admittedly rather stylish wooden boxes is that cat owners have somewhere to keep their pet’s fallen whiskers (makers Be-Glad stress that owners should not attempt to trim or pluck a cat’s whiskers) or deciduous teeth as they grow, acting as a keepsake for when the cat is older or, perhaps, passes away.

With plenty of room for the whiskers of even the grandest cat, these memorial boxes are made with wood from Japanese empress trees and come with patterns and the words “Neko no Hige” (quite literally the “cat’s whiskers”) engraved into them.

Amazon JP

The boxes even come with a sheet of gold tissue paper to wrap your pet’s whiskers in before placing them in the case. After all, you wouldn’t want to disrespect your cat by putting its whiskers directly into a box, now would you?

For those who would rather keep their cat’s milk teeth, Be-Glad is offering up round containers which feature either a cat silhouette or paw design.

Quite who would want to collect and store their pet’s teeth and whiskers, we’re not entirely sure, but we only imagine the makers of these boxes are hoping to tap into owners’ desires to dote on their pets like they do or would their own children. Keeping a couple of your child’s first milk teeth is fairly common in many parts of the world, but in Japan it is also common for mothers to keep the stumps of their child’s umbilical cord after it drops off. These heso-no-o (or “tail of the belly button”) are kept in small containers and kept like a parent in the West might their child’s hospital bracelet. Mmm, boxed umbilical stump!

▼ Be-Glad also offers wooden (human) umbilical cord stump cases

This all makes us wonder, though: do you purchase a cat whisker case and then spend the next few months on your hands and knees hunting for enough fallen whiskers to fill it, or do you gather them up as soon as you spot them and then put in an order for a whisker case? If you happen to have any advice about proper whisker collection decorum, be sure to let us know in the comments section below!

Oh, and in case you were wondering how popular these cat whisker and milk tooth cases are with Japanese consumers, both are currently completely sold out on Amazon JP.

Money well spent, if you ask this not-at-all-sarcastic or cold-hearted Brit…

"We bump into Kuratas, the 120 million-yen robot, at the Tokyo Toy Show",2015-06-23T11:30:46Z,"Many of you may recall the three-meter-tall (12.5 feet) ridable Japanese robot known as Kuratas which we have covered many times before. Earlier this year the real-life mecha made waves when it went up for sale on Amazon for the sum of 120 million yen (US$978,000).

For years now, Kuratas has been charming wannabe mech-pilots around the world until its most recent offering in January, but since then things have been quiet on the giant robot front. So you can imagine our Mr. Sato’s surprise when he stumbled upon one by chance during a trip to the 2015 Tokyo Toy Show.

This Kuratas was a little different from the ones we’ve seen before. Rather than the sold grey paint job, this one was done up in an eye-catching red…as if a huge robot suit needed to be more eye-catching. Its left arm had also been replaced with a cannon of sorts.

Kuratas was brought here today to celebrate the launch of a new Takara Tomy line of toys called Gagan Gun. Aside from having a name that’s really fun to say, Gagan Guns are remote-controlled robots that you can engage others with in laser tag battles. In a special collaboration between the toy giant and giant toy, Takara Tomi had made two special Gagan Guns designed in the likeness of Kuratas.

Of course Mr. Sato hung around the Gagan Gun display for a demonstration of Kuratas along with many other Toy Show attendees. The crowd oohed as the driver climbed into her Kuratas cockpit and ahhed as she triumphantly raised her arm canon in the air. It was all enough to make Mr. Sato decided right then and there that he would buy a Kuratas for himself and drive it around town. It was his destiny.

▼ Hot driver sold separately



After arriving home, he went to check Amazon. Luckily, there was still one Kuratas starter kit left in stock for the same price it was selling for earlier this year. However, even after getting his vast Subway, Pizza Hut, and Krispy Kreme loyalty card collections appraised, Mr. Sato was still woefully short of 120 million yen.

On the other hand, he did have enough to get a Gagan Gun Kuratas selling at only 3,700 yen ($30). Granted he wouldn’t look nearly as intimidating driving it around the streets of Tokyo, but it’d have to do for now.

Amazon wants to ship your data to the cloud using a literal truck,2016-11-30T19:28:38Z,"Amazon just announced a new service called AWS Snowmobile, which is a 21st century version of the classic “sneakernet” method of data transport. Basically, Amazon is offering to tow a 45-foot-long shipping container full of hard drives to your data center, plug in to your servers via fiber, and siphon off up to 100 petabytes (a petabyte is 1 million gigabytes) of data. That shipping container is then transported to an Amazon data center where all the data is uploaded to S3 or Amazon Glacier, Amazon’s cloud data storage services.

This is a sizable upgrade over Amazon’s existing Snowball service, in which Amazon ships you a secure 80TB “Storage Appliance” to load your data onto over 10Gbps Ethernet. Amazon just announced a new version of Snowball (pictured above) with more storage and faster networking, but it’s still not “exabyte scale,” so the company decided to build something even bigger. With the new Snowmobile service, Amazon says you could ship one exabyte (an exabyte is 1,000 petabytes) of data to AWS in about six months — a feat which would take roughly 26 years over a 10Gbps dedicated connection. The Snowmobile truck’s network cable is capable of transporting up to 1Tbps over multiple 40Gbps connections into the shipping container’s capacious hold.",https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/11/30/13797212/amazon-aws-snowmobile-snowball-cloud-storage-truck

"Best Low-Budget Horror Films on Netflix, Amazon Prime",2016-07-20T18:44:00Z,"It’s summer time, and the living is kinda miserable. Rather than go outside during the day, why not spend lazy, hot afternoon streaming some scary flicks and eating junk food? From classic scares to drama to comedy, there’s something online for everyone.

Last Shift

If you’re a fan of classic horror elements, Last Shift has pretty much all of them, packaged in a surprisingly convincing story about a rookie cop assigned to wait alone for a clean up crew at an abandoned police station. Surprise, the station was abandoned because it’s home to Something Evil. Juliana Harkavy (The Walking Dead) is alone on screen for a lot of the film, but she carries the film effectively to its terrifying show down. It’s on Netflix and it’s hella scary.

We Are Still Here

“Every 30 years or so, the goddamn place just wakes up, and it demands new blood!” This line from the trailer sums up the premise of We Are Still Here, a haunted house movie. Oh, it’s a rural New England house, recently moved into by some nice older white people who are going through some stuff. It’s a weird, gory, and well-crafted debut for director Ted Geoghagen, and it’s also pretty scary. You can stream it on Netflix.

Creep

If found-footage films are your jam, this one from Patrick Brice and Mark Duplass definitely lives up to the title. The story follows Aaron (Brice), a videographer who answers a Craigslist ad (uh-oh) from Josef (Duplass). It’s basically the worst Craiglist horror story you can imagine, but Duplass is riveting as the nice-on-the-surface guy who just seems off. It’s funny at disarming (and disturbing) moments and yeah, very creepy. You can watch it on Netflix.

Hush

Available on Netflix, this latest offering from Mike Flanagan is a taut home invasion thriller with a twist: the protagonist, played by co-writer Kate Siegel, is deaf and mute. She lives alone in the woods until (you can see where this is going) she is stalked by a masked psycho murderer. It sounds like well-trod territory, but Hush keeps it fresh and thrilling. While Flanagan nixed the early idea of having an entirely silent film, he sticks to low key ambient sounds and white noise while still effectively building a tense and intensely creepy film.

Deathgasm

It would be just plain irresponsible to exclude a horror comedy pick from this list. Deathgasm is ridiculous and ridiculously gory film out of New Zealand about misfit teams who form a heavy metal band and accidentally summon a demon. An homage to metal and horror, it’s got that droll New Zealand humor, it’s funny and bloody in equal measure, and it goes at all these elements full tilt with a delightful manic energy. It’s streaming on Netflix

Zoombies

We’d also be remiss to exclude a so-bad-it’s-funny pick, so if that’s your poison, kill some brain cells with Zoombies — that’s zoo zombies. There’s literally not much else to say about it, other than it is weirdly insistent on playing off of Jurassic Park visually. Also found on Netflix.

He Never Died

In this Canadian supernatural action/horror/comedy, Henry Rollins plays a grouchy, immortal entity in the form of a grouchy, meathead human. Roger Ebert described the character as “the demonic love-child of the Terminator and Starman, a stranger from afar who is unaccustomed to, or perhaps just uninterested in human niceties.” He’s weird, and compelling to watch as he goes on a rampage to rescue his estranged teen daughter. It’s pretty bonkers, but charming at the same time. It can be streamed on Netflix.

Bone Tomahawk

Not quite as low budget as the rest, this one stars Kurt Russel and some other recognizable faces, like Patrick Wilson and Matthew Fox. It’s also not for everyone. A horror western, Bone Tomahawk revolves around a small town sheriff in search of a kidnapped woman, and it involves cannibals. It’s a slow build, with great dialogue and performances, leading up to a seriously fucked up conclusion. You can stream it on Amazon Prime.

Plague

Plague is a classic zombie apocalypse movie out of Australia. It’s quite beautiful for the low budget, filmed in muted tones in rural Australia, with lovely dramatic performances from local actors. It doesn’t bring anything surprising or innovative to the genre, but if you like zombie flicks, this is a quality little film with more character drama than gore and jump scares. It’s available on Netflix.

Stake Land

I may have only watched this vampire/zombie apocalypse hybrid because a guy I know was an extra, but it’s actually a very satisfying thriller. Set in a vampire apocalypse that has cause the collapse of civilization that is a surprisingly astute allegory for rural Americana, it follows a young orphaned boy who is taken in by a grizzled vampire hunter. They traverse a desolate and dangerous rural landscape trying to reach a rumored “New Eden”. It’s on Netflix.",https://www.inverse.com/article/18235-best-horror-movies-stream-netflix-amazon
Amazon Prime Day Disappoints With Bad Deals and Tech Fails,2016-07-12T20:44:00Z,"Amazon Prime Day is back for its second year, and it kind of sucks, again. The one-day shopping extravaganza was a roaring success for the retailer last year, which recorded bigger sales figures than Black Friday even though customers complained that the stuff on sale was a bunch of junk. This year is no different: customers are venting their frustrations at bad deals (a discount on Tupperware? Wow!), but Amazon’s checkout system is still struggling under the pressure to sell people all their stuff.

The deals are only available for one day to Amazon Prime customers, who pay a $99 annual subscription fee (although Amazon stresses you can cancel anytime). For that rate, you’d think the deals would be pretty hefty, but beyond a select few top deals like 48 percent off a Samsung 55-inch 4K TV or $30 off the latest Doom video game, there’s not a whole lot to write home about.

As with most instances of public mild annoyance, people hopped on Twitter to deliver biting critiques of the company.

Some of the most publicized deals are on Amazon’s own hardware. The Fire TV Gaming Edition is on sale with $30 off, while the Fire TV Stick is on sale with $15 off. Still, people weren’t impressed.

It’s hard to get too excited about deals on products that were fairly cheap to start with, but Prime Day could be a big ecosystem boost for Amazon. The store dropped Apple and Google streaming devices late last year, as they were incompatible with the Prime streaming service bundled in with Prime subscriptions. Yes, the same Prime subscription that you need to take part in Prime Day. It’s easy to see how, for Amazon, it may not be so much about the size of the deals, but about drawing attention to the company’s current offerings and building up (or retaining) Prime subscriptions.

Beyond half-hearted deals aimed at building a userbase, it seems Amazon may not have foreseen some of the site issues cropping up today. Amazon’s official Twitter account seemed to suggest the company had not prepared as much as it could for the onslaught of thirsty shoppers.

Sorry about your cart Ms. Mach, but Amazon is on the case. Wait, no, a bunch of other people are struggling too.

This guy even got up early!

There’s always next year.",https://www.inverse.com/article/18165-amazon-prime-day-deals-bad-tech
Amazon Prepares For Prime Day's Big Comeback,2016-07-12T02:26:00Z,"Last year, Amazon’s Prime Day went down in history as one of the least exciting made-up consumer shopping holidays ever. The sale’s limited offerings were deemed less-than-desirable by a crowd that was hoping for Black Friday-style deals on home appliances and technology. Needless to say, very few people were enthused when the company announced a second annual Prime Day sale, and expectations have run high when it comes to the sale’s hopeful comeback tomorrow, July 12th.

Despite consumer backlash across social media, Prime Day was still credited for boosting revenue by two percentage points last summer, with a total of 34.4 million items sold. So no matter what anyone says, the company made more than even last year, and the lessons of its first year are showing in the much more interesting selection available tomorrow.

According to past releases, the sales will include twice as many deals on staples such as smart TVs, phones, tablets, and laptops as Black Friday, with over 100,000 deals available to choose from just for Amazon Prime customers.

Ahead of the sale, Amazon revealed a list of items on sale early, including $300 off a 15” HP Quad-Core Notebook and other gadgets, though the best deals on tech rest within Amazon’s brand wheelhouse. Fire TV will be $30 off, Amazon’s Echo will be 50% off, and the Fire tablet will start for $33.33.

There’s still a bit of dismay surrounding the sale, primarily because it means most customers (at least those who don’t cancel their memberships within 30 days) will essentially be paying a $100 entry fee in order to participate in the sale. At the heart of it, Prime Day is about bringing in new Prime subscribers, so if you’re not in it for the long haul, keep that in mind.

But this year, with deals that are more competitive with those on Black Friday and other consumer-based “holidays,” most Prime subscribers seem hopeful.

Others had advice for marketing future Prime Days:

While a shortlist of deals is already out, most of the company’s deals remain a mystery for now. Most of the deals will occur throughout the day, with new discounts occurring hourly, beginning at midnight Eastern time.",https://www.inverse.com/article/18149-prime-day-is-tomorrow
Crunchyroll Isn't Worried About Netflix and Amazon Focusing More on Anime,2017-12-24T14:00:00Z,"With the growth of anime’s popularity in the west, streaming platforms you wouldn’t necessarily expect to take a vested interest in anime have recently devoted more resources to it. At the beginning of the year, Amazon launched a new anime subscription service called Anime Strike, which currently consists of anime streaming exclusively on Amazon Video, in addition to other licensed series. Though the service came with major issues, like requiring customers to have a pricey Amazon Prime membership to even pay the subscription fee, it quickly established itself as the only legal source in the US for some of the best anime of the season.

Later in the year, Netflix also made some bold moves in the anime space, releasing high profile anime-inspired series like Castlevania, announcing a slew of new anime coming to the platform in 2017 and 2018, and revealing that they were working on 30 original anime series.

All this sounds great for anime fans, if a little overwhelming. But you would think that the two most subscribed streaming video on demand services in the US paying more attention to anime might be a cause of concern for Crunchyroll, one of the dyed-in-the-wool anime streaming services out there. But for the company, which has been operating in the anime community since its founding in 2006, that isn’t the case.

“We’re perfectly thrilled if more users around the world discover or become curious about anime through one of the larger global streaming [platforms],” Crunchyroll COO Colin Decker told Inverse. “That’s great, because that’s good for anime. And what we know is that anyone who really wants to go deeper is going to end up at Crunchyroll eventually. And this is simply for the reason that we have it all.”

By “all,” Decker means the 1,022 anime with separate entries in Crunchyroll’s US library, a figure which is more than double that of their closest US competitor numbers-wise, Funimation (448), who mostly streams dubbed anime. (Crunchyroll and Funimation share parts of their libraries as a result of them partnering in September last year.) The gap is even larger compared to their closest US competitor numbers-wise who mostly streams subbed anime, Hulu (388), meaning it’s larger still relative to the total separately listed anime in Netflix (95) and Anime Strike’s (149) US catalogs. (Anime Strike is only available in the US, but anime on the service can be streamed elsewhere with a Prime Video subscription. In addition to Hulu, the other mentioned streamers stream subbed anime for the most part.)

Of course, Amazon, Hulu, and Netflix aren’t concentrated on anime in the same way that Crunchyroll and Funimation are, and Amazon and Netflix focusing more on anime is a relatively new thing. So the two platforms could always get caught up to Crunchyroll eventually. But VRV (“verve”), a streaming platform which shares an umbrella company, Ellation, with Crunchyroll and has Crunchyroll as one of its channels, doesn’t think that will happen, at least where Netflix is concerned.

“If Netflix wanted to have every anime title, they could. They have enough money to do it, but I just don’t think that that would be in the cards for them…they’re never going to go really deep ‘cause it doesn’t make sense,” Arlen Marmel, General Manager of VRV, told Inverse in a separate interview. “If you think about the Crunchyroll subscriber base, or frankly any of the channel partners for VRV, whether it’s like a Shudder or Rooster Teeth, they all subscribe to Netflix,” Marmel added. “There’s a hundred percent overlap. So…they already have them if that makes sense.”

Given that one of Netflix’s goals is to provide their subscribers with the greatest variety of content available, while the Ellation slogan is “be everything to someone, not something to everyone,” Marmel’s assessment doesn’t seem off the mark.

Crunchyroll’s confidence doesn’t just come from the number of titles on their site, though. According to Marmel, their approach to anime and anime-related content is what separates them from some of their competitors. “I think a lot of people saw the opportunity to cash in on [anime’s rising popularity] and participate,” Marmel said. “But I feel like the audience can tell the difference between the good stuff and the questionable stuff.” Over time, Marmel continues, “you won’t trust [services delivering questionable content] in the same way that hopefully you would trust a Crunchyroll or trust a VRV.”

In relation to Netflix specifically, the different ways the streaming platforms handle their content don’t stop there. Crunchyroll places an emphasis on simulcasts, episodes subscribers have access to the same day they air in Japan, with non-subscribers having to wait a week to get that content for free at a lower video quality with ads. This is a departure from the model of Netflix which, in terms of anime series, provides full seasons as its primary offering to US subscribers, but one that’s successful because Crunchyroll’s audience wants to be as up to date as possible. “Our fans come together over the timeliness of that new content and really, really deeply enjoy that,” Decker said. (Netflix Japan adds anime episodes individually after they air, but of course, Netflix can control what counts as timely when it comes to original series being exclusively released on the platform.)

For the fall season, Crunchyroll offered 57 simulcasts in the US, some of which, like their overall library, could be the result of their partnership with Funimation (which obviously works both ways). Of the other US streamers, Anime Strike comes closest to this number with 10 simulcasts for fall, which is still a long ways off. (Funimation’s English language simuldubs are available within two weeks of the Japan airdate. The service offered

simuldubs for fall 2017.)

Crunchyroll’s decision to release episodes the day they air in Japan and not all at once afterward isn’t just important with regard to being up to date, Marmel thinks. Riffing on a common criticism of binge-watching, where people watch multiple episodes of a TV show one after another, Marmel said that a result of this behavior is that you lose some of the opportunity to “[dissect] each episode.” “If you think of Game of Thrones, there’s podcasts and articles and people trying to uncover stuff. If they just released Game of Thrones [all at once], that’s all gone, instantly,” Marmel said. “I don’t think it makes sense to treat it like it’s perishable…It’s something you want to live with for a while,” he said later in the interview.

In a similar way to putting out “questionable stuff” resulting in the audience eventually mistrusting you, Marmel argues that mostly or exclusively facilitating binge-watching will eventually lead to viewers “[treating] you like a utility and not something that really matters to their life.” And this mentality of wanting to have a relationship with fans is key to why Crunchyroll is comfortable with its position in the anime community.

Rather than a “utility,” Decker said that their users “look to [Crunchyroll] as a friend and an authority.” He explained that the platform is involved in “a constant and highly engaged conversation with [their] audience,” citing how they do things like spotlight community voices, hold events like nationwide movie nights and the Crunchyroll Expo convention — which started this year — and have a general anime- and manga-related news arm. They also have forums which “typically light up after a new episode of a hot title has aired,” according to Decker, offering another way for the community to engage and “share” an experience that isn’t present on the bigger streaming platforms. This is at least partially the result of them being able to focus on one thing, and for that thing to be something that passes VRV’s T-shirt test, meaning you would want to wear a reference to it on a T-shirt at Comic Con. Along with the amount of anime available on Crunchyroll, Decker said that all this adds up to “a very different POV than one of the gigantic global mass market SVOD [streaming video on demand] services.”

Marmel takes this sentiment a step further. “If everything that was on Netflix was just on a different service called ‘whatever’, would people shed a tear? I don’t know,” he said. “If something happened to Crunchyroll, people would be upset.”

Based on the sometimes very different number of shows available in each region Crunchyroll has a presence in, as well as the events they have access to, the relationship the company enjoys with fans does vary country to country. Still, Miles Thomas, Head of Community for Crunchyroll, said over email that “just because our HQ is in North America doesn’t mean that’s the extent of our attention…There are contests, news, events, and unique social media presences in each of our major regions, and we’re always working with our various regional managers to do joint promotions.” He added that “every Crunchyroll community is very different, but they all share the focus on the fans, and providing a platform for them to engage.”

Crunchyroll isn’t content to stay the course and hope for the best, though. While their main focus is and will continue to be anime, they may increasingly not be limited to it in the future. The platform currently hosts a number of live-action titles, but the category hasn’t been updated recently. However, Crunchyroll partnered with production company RocketJump for the original live-action series Anime Crimes Division, which debuted on RocketJump’s YouTube channel on November 16 and had its season finale on November 30. Following the premiere of the series, Decker said the show could count as the first original scripted live-action series they’ve been involved with — though he was quick to note they’ve been creating live-action content for years — and confirmed to Inverse that the company is currently “looking at” future live-action opportunities, both original and licensed, as long as they make sense.

From an outsider’s perspective, the only thing Crunchyroll might be worried about right now is where anime — defined as animation that comes from Japan, even though it can be animated outside of the country — goes next with more western players taking part in its production and distribution. Decker explained that anime is already “evolving” in response to this. “I think most people view that as a really healthy and good thing. However, there are some aspects of what makes anime so compelling to this community that are going to change, that people are going to experiment with and they may find doesn’t resonate.”

Ultimately, though, based on the decade-plus of experience they have partnering with Japanese licensors, and the growth they’ve brought about so far, Decker thinks that “the bulk of that innovation will be really more driven…by Crunchyroll.”

"Living in cars, working for Amazon: meet America's new nomads",2017-12-02T15:42:12Z,"Millions of Americans are wrestling with the impossibility of a traditional middle-class existence. In homes across the country, kitchen tables are strewn with unpaid bills. Lights burn late into the night. The same calculations get performed again and again, through exhaustion and sometimes tears.



Wages minus grocery receipts. Minus medical bills. Minus credit card debt. Minus utility fees. Minus student loan and car payments. Minus the biggest expense of all: rent.

In the widening gap between credits and debits hangs a question: which bits of this life are you willing to give up, so you can keep on living?

During three years of research for my book, Nomadland: Surviving America in The Twenty-First Century, I spent time with hundreds of people who had arrived at the same answer. They gave up traditional housing and moved into “wheel estate”: RVs, travel trailers, vans, pickup campers, even a salvaged Prius and other sedans. For many, sacrificing some material comforts had allowed them to survive, while reclaiming a small measure of freedom and autonomy. But that didn’t mean life on the road was easy.

My first encounter with one group of the new nomads came in 2013, at the Desert Rose RV park in Fernley, Nevada. It was populated by members of the “precariat”: temporary laborers doing short-term jobs in exchange for low wages. Its citizens were full-time wanderers who dwelled in RVs and other vehicles, though at least one guy had only a tent to live in. Many were in their 60s and 70s, approaching or well into traditional retirement age. Most could not afford to stop working – or pay the rent.

Since 2009, the year after the housing crash, groups of such workers had migrated each fall to the mobile home parks surrounding Fernley. Most had traveled hundreds of miles – and undergone the routine indignities of criminal background checks and pee-in-a-cup drug tests – for the chance to earn $11.50 an hour plus overtime at temporary warehouse jobs. They planned to stay through early winter, despite the fact that most of their homes on wheels weren’t designed to support life in subzero temperatures.

Their employer was Amazon.

Amazon recruited these workers as part of a program it calls CamperForce: a labor unit made up of nomads who work as seasonal employees at several of its warehouses, which the company calls “fulfillment centers”.

Along with thousands of traditional temps, they’re hired to meet the heavy shipping demands of “peak season” – the consumer bonanza that spans the three to four months before Christmas.

While other employers also seek out this nomadic workforce – the available jobs range from campground maintenance to selling Christmas trees and running amusement park rides – Amazon has been the most aggressive recruiter. “Jeff Bezos has predicted that, by the year 2020, one out of every four work-campers – the RV- and vehicle-dwellers who travel the country for temporary work – in the United States will have worked for Amazon,” read one slide in a presentation for new hires.

The ranks of American itinerants started to boom after the housing collapse and have kept growing

Amazon doesn’t disclose precise staffing numbers to the press, but when I casually asked a CamperForce manager at an Amazon recruiting booth in Arizona about the size of the program, her estimate was some 1,400 workers.

The workers’ shifts last 10 hours or longer, during which some walk more than 15 miles on concrete floors, stooping, squatting, reaching, and climbing stairs as they scan, sort, and box merchandise. When the holiday rush ends, Amazon no longer needs CamperForce and terminates the program’s workers. They drive away in what managers cheerfully call a “taillight parade”.

The first member of CamperForce I corresponded with at great length, over a period of months, was a man I’ll call Don Wheeler. Don had spent the last two years of his main career as a software executive, traveling to Hong Kong, Paris, Sydney and Tel Aviv.

Retiring in 2002 meant he could finally stay in one place: the 1930s’ Spanish colonial revival house he shared with his wife in Berkeley, California. It also gave him time to indulge a lifelong obsession with fast cars. He bought a red-and-white Mini Cooper S and souped it up to 210 horsepower, practicing until he was named third overall in the US Touring Car Championship pro series.

The fast times didn’t last.

When I started exchanging emails with Don, he was 69, divorced, and staying at the Desert Rose RV park near the warehouse in Fernley. His wife had gotten to keep the house. The 2008 market crash had vaporized his savings. He had been forced to sell the Mini Cooper. In his old life, he’d spent about $100,000 a year. In his new one, he learned to get by on as little as $75 a week.

By the end of the 2013 holiday season, Don anticipated he’d be working at the Amazon warehouse five nights a week until just before dawn, on overtime shifts lasting 12 hours, with 30 minutes off for lunch and two 15-minute breaks. He’d spend most of the time on his feet, receiving and scanning inbound freight. “It’s hard work, but the money’s good,” he explained.

Don told me that he was part of a growing phenomenon. He and most of the CamperForce – along with a broader spectrum of itinerant laborers – called themselves “workampers”. Though I’d already stumbled across that word, I’d never heard anyone define it with as much flair as Don. He wrote in a Facebook direct message to me:

Workampers are modern mobile travelers who take temporary jobs around the US in exchange for a free campsite – usually including power, water and sewer connections – and perhaps a stipend. You may think that workamping is a modern phenomenon, but we come from a long, long tradition.

We followed the Roman legions, sharpening swords and repairing armor. We roamed the new cities of America, fixing clocks and machines, repairing cookware, building stone walls for a penny a foot and all the hard cider we could drink.

We followed the emigration west in our wagons with our tools and skills, sharpening knives, fixing anything that was broken, helping clear the land, roof the cabin, plow the fields and bring in the harvest for a meal and pocket money, then moving on to the next job.

Our forebears are the tinkers. We have upgraded the tinker’s wagon to a comfortable motor coach or fifth-wheel trailer.

Mostly retired now, we have added to our repertoire the skills of a lifetime in business. We can help run your shop, handle the front or back of the house, drive your trucks and forklifts, pick and pack your goods for shipment, fix your machines, coddle your computers and networks, work your beet harvest, landscape your grounds or clean your bathrooms. We are the techno-tinkers.

Other workampers I spoke with had their own ways of describing themselves. Many said they were “retired”, even if they anticipated working well into their 70s or 80s. Others called themselves “travelers”, “nomads”, “rubber tramps”, or, wryly, “gypsies”.

Outside observers gave them other nicknames, from “the Okies of the Great Recession” to “American refugees”, “the affluent homeless”, even “modern-day fruit tramps”.

There’s no clear count of how many people live nomadically in America. Full-time travelers are a demographer’s nightmare. Statistically they blend in with the rest of the population, since the law requires them to maintain fixed – in other words, fake – addresses.

Despite a lack of hard numbers, anecdotal evidence suggests the ranks of American itinerants started to boom after the housing collapse and have kept growing.

The cause of the unmanageable household math that drives some people to become nomads is no secret.

Federal minimum wage is stalled at $7.25 an hour. The cost of shelter continues to climb. There are now only a dozen counties and one metro area where a full-time minimum-wage worker can afford a one-bedroom apartment at fair market rent.

At the same time, the top 1% now makes 81 times more than those in the bottom half do, when you compare average earnings. For American adults on the lower half of the income ladder – some 117 million of them – earnings haven’t changed since the 1970s.

This is not a wage gap – it’s a chasm.

The most widely accepted measure for calculating income inequality is a century-old formula called the Gini coefficient. What it reveals is startling. Today the United States has the most unequal society of all developed nations. America’s level of inequality is comparable to that of Russia, China, Argentina and the war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo.

And a bad as that economic situation is now, it’s likely to get worse. That makes me wonder: what further contortions of the social order will appear in years to come? How many people will get crushed by the system? How many will find a way to escape it?

Despite mounting pressures – including a nationwide crackdown on vehicle-dwelling – America’s modern-day nomads show great resilience. But how much of that toughness should our culture require for basic membership? And when do all the impossible choices start to tear people – a society – apart? The growing ranks of folks living on the road suggest the answer might be: much sooner than we think.

Amazon workers at an Italy distribution hub are planning to strike on Black Friday,2017-11-23T15:50:14Z,"Over 500 Amazon workers at the company’s main distribution hub in Italy are planning to go on strike on Black Friday, reports Reuters. Italian trade unions said the workers from Amazon’s Piacenza hub in northern Italy had agreed to strike for the first time after they failed to negotiate bonuses with Amazon. The workers also want pay raises to compensate for mandatory night shifts, overtime, or working six days in a row to keep up with logistical demands.

Additionally, starting from Black Friday, the striking workers will refuse overtime during the holiday season — typically the busiest season for the company — until December 31st.

The Piacenza hub has 1,600 permanent employees, and it was the first one built in Italy after Amazon launched a local site there in 2010. In a statement sent to Reuters, Amazon said it remains focused on trying to get deliveries to customers on time on Black Friday and in the days after. It also noted that its workers’ salaries are among the highest in the logistics sector with some benefits like private health insurance and subsidies for training programs included.

Many European countries, including Italy, have adopted the Black Friday shopping tradition, set a day after Thanksgiving.",https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/23/16694238/amazon-italy-distribution-hub-striking-black-friday
8 Crazy Series Pitches,2017-11-21T21:05:00Z,"When Amazon announced that it had shilled out a king’s ransom to buy the television rights to J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings, fans took very little time to rejoice before asking questions. How could Amazon possibly narrow down Tolkien’s world enough to make a coherent television show?

Amazon’s newly announced series is said to be a “prequel” to Tolkien’s The Lord of the Rings — and we know nothing else beyond that. So, confusion is understandable. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t options.

Because Tolkien’s collected works span across such a vivid world and encompass so many themes and characters, Amazon’s possibilities are essentially endless. The creators at Amazon could either adapt one of the hundreds of potential stories directly from Tolkien’s works, or they could come up with something entirely original that just so happens to exist in Middle-earth and intersect with beloved characters.

In honor of the oddities found so often throughout Tolkien’s world, we thought we’d throw together some television pitches for Amazon ranging from the reasonable to the reasonably insane. Some of these are, admittedly, a little out there. But, come on, cooking shows are all the rage right now.

8. A total reboot of Peter Jackson’s The Hobbit

Yes? Yes.

7. The Adventures of Tom Bombadil

Pre-Lord of the Rings, Tom Bombadil arrived at a land outside of the Old Forest; he set up a home and it eventually became known as his dominion. But how did he get there? Tom was wholly ignored in Jackson’s interpretation of LOTR, though he was a key player and is often a fan favorite character; his mysterious powers were thought by Gandalf to have a sort of dampening effect on the One Ring and its control over others. An exploration of his life and adventures before the events of LOTR would certainly be equally entertaining and telling.

6. The Real Elves of Mirkwood and Lothlórien

The elves are the most dramatic assholes in Middle-earth, so they’d be perfect for a Real Housewives-style television show. Don’t deny it; you know it’s true. Following various Wood-elf families throughout Mirkwood and Lothlórien, viewers would get an intimate look at the passive-aggressive infighting that goes on between the elves. Galadriel is the only one people wouldn’t talk shit about. The Season 1 finale would be all about King Thranduil’s complicated relationship with his son, Legolas, and would mostly consist of footage of tipsy palace servants giving the camera judgmental side-eyes.

5. A year in the life of the Great Eagles

The Great Eagles, guardians of Middle-earth and the king of Arda’s spies and confidants, have to have some of the best stories of all the creatures in Tolkien’s works. They can see through all matter outside of dark magic and save the heroes of Tolkien’s books time and time again. Let’s get an Owls of Ga’Hoole-style look into the lives of the Great Eagles, especially Gwaihir, who’s besties with Gandalf and pops up the most of all the Eagles.

BBC

4. Downton Abbey-style drama set exclusively in the Shire

The peaceful Hobbits of the Shire just love their family drama. That’s why they’d do so well in a Downton Abbey-style show that follows the lives of various families across the Shire. They would gossip and whisper about each other and try their hardest to hold onto their peaceful way of life as the world changed around them as the events of Lord of the Rings and the war approached.

3. Singing competition about the creation of Middle-earth

Tolkien’s legendarium details the Ainulindalë, the creation of Middle-earth by the Ainur, angelic beings who, essentially, sang Middle-earth into existence. The story is the first part of The Silmarillion, so you know it’s important to Tolkien’s greater works. The only problem is that no one was there to judge the Ainur for their vocal prowess. How do we know that they didn’t sound like a clowder of cats in heat or a dying whale? It could have been horrible. That’s why we need an expert panel of judges to rate the Ainur’s work; Middle-earth could have been that much better with some vocal training.

2. Literally nothing but dwarves feasting and singing

Imagine it: 24, hour-long episodes of a herd of dwarves traveling around Middle-earth and inundating various groups of men, elves, and hobbits with their company. The unwilling hosts then have to throw together a feast to keep the dwarves happy. The dwarves eat them out of house and home, singing and reciting poetry the whole time as they work their way through gallons of beer. Bonus points if the dwarves can even get through the doors of an elf’s house.

1. Cooking show hosted by Samwise Gamgee where the dishes are all potato based

“Boil ‘em, mash ‘em, stick ‘em in a stew,” Sam famously said of his one true love, potatoes, in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. “Lovely big golden chips with a nice piece of fried fish.” Sam Gamgee would be the perfect host for a Middle-earth cooking show, utterly obsessed with the potato-only dishes and endlessly enthusiastic in comparison to the judges, the enigmatic Ent Treebeard, Tom Bombadil, and Radegast, as well as the guest panel of dwarf judges that show up every once in a while. That’s when the food starts flying.

Can Amazon's 'Lord of the Rings' Top HBO's 'Game of Thrones'?,2017-11-14T22:36:00Z,"If you’re a network executive, how do you compete with Game of Thrones? Sure, there’s only one season left of the landmark HBO series, but talks of spin-offs have inundated the news cycle for months, and the Season 7 finale tallied a whopping but not unexpected 12.1 million viewers.

If you’re Jeff Bezos, the Season 7 finale was a stark reminder that Amazon needed its own Game of Thrones. The answer to this dragon-sized problem turned out to be the OG master of high fantasy, J.R.R. Tolkien.

On Monday, Amazon announced that it had made a deal with the Tolkien estate and Warner Bros. — reportedly spending up to $250 million — to acquire the television rights to Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings series. “The television adaptation will explore new storylines preceding J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring,” Amazon revealed in a press release.

The late Tolkien, a war veteran, university professor, philologist, poet, and all-around stereotypical 19th and early 20th-century Englishman, had an expectedly convoluted writing style. He didn’t take future TV adaptations into account when writing about Pippin and Merry hanging out with an ancient talking tree. He wasn’t George R.R. Martin.

Amazon now has a tough road ahead: Tolkien first published The Hobbit in 1937 and his three-volume masterpiece The Lord of the Rings — The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, and The Return of the King — between 1954 and 1955.

Three hours of this might not be so bad, actually.

The language of the time — and Tolkien’s habit of writing 30-page descriptions of feasting dwarves and the way the wind sounds in the trees — will almost undoubtedly be cut to make way for extended action sequences, quick quips, and more culturally relevant topics.

That’s not to say Amazon’s show won’t somehow maintain Tolkien’s encyclopedically thorough style, themes of adventure, bravery, and what it means to be a good person, and a ridiculous amount of Elvish. But it will be simplified, assuming it’s even based on an existing Tolkien work at all.

Don't be upset, Legolas; this is a good thing.

Unsurprisingly, Amazon’s newly announced, totally mysterious Lord of the Rings show drew almost immediate comparison to HBO’s Game of Thrones adaptation, which is… fair. Martin’s Game of Thrones is the closest thing we have to Tolkien’s genre-defining fantasy series in the 21st century.

GoT showrunners D.B. Weiss and David Benioff famously went “off-book” for Seasons 6 and 7 due to the whole “Martin hasn’t technically published those stories yet” thing. Martin acted as a guiding hand, letting the pair in on where he was planning on taking the story, but, ultimately, Benioff and Weiss drove the narrative. And even then, the show has continued to hold the world’s attention in a rare way; Martin, an American sci-fi, horror, and fantasy writer with a background in television and screenwriting, wrote an epic series that was begging to be adapted for TV. It works for a reason.

Amazon is hoping for a similar cultural obsession for its Lord of the Rings series. Peter Jackson’s monumental trilogy adaptation, released between 2001 and 2003, made more than $1 billion at the domestic box office and swept awards shows with the same fierceness Game of Thrones has.

'Game of Thrones' destroying the competition at the Emmy Awards. Giphy

A Lord of the Rings television series, whether a multi-season longform narrative or an anthology project, like some are anticipating, will almost invariably succeed. Just like with Game of Thrones, there will be plenty of purists crying false, but there’s no way in hell a straight book-to-show Lord of the Rings adaptation would be fun to watch. It just wouldn’t be.

Comparisons between the two shows are astute because, if anything, Martin has always cited Tolkien as one of his greatest influences, but with the caveat that he’s also one of Tolkien’s biggest critics.

While speaking at the Edinburgh International Book Festival in 2014, Martin said, “I revere Lord of the Rings, I reread it every few years, it had an enormous effect on me as a kid.” Martin has also publicly questioned Aragorn’s tax codes (no joke) and always considered Tolkien’s story to be too simple.

“Lord of the Rings had a very medieval philosophy: that if the king was a good man, the land would prosper, Martin said in a 2014 interview with Rolling Stone. “We look at real history and it’s not that simple.”

Tolkien’s fictional world has a rich history, but in many ways, it’s actually quite simple, and his prose is flowery. That’s a combination that will likely prove much more difficult to adapt for TV than Martin’s saga. That “sound of wind in the trees” thing would be good for a pretty intro song and nothing else.

The Winds of Winter, the penultimate novel in Martin’s series, is hopefully expected to publish sometime before the show’s Season 8 premiere, though no promises have been made. Martin’s still writing and advising Weiss and Benioff on the direction of the story.

Meanwhile, Tolkien died in 1973 and anything that’s come out since then, including the history of Middle-earth, The Silmarillion, has been published posthumously by his son, Christopher Tolkien. The amount of creative control allotted to Amazon by the Tolkien estate is currently unknown, but it’s not like Tolkien isaround to provide incredibly detailed opinions about the show.

Lord of the Rings, ultimately a pure story filled to the brim with triumph and bittersweet happiness, will undoubtedly change to fit the small screen more than Game of Thrones and all its corrupt, prostitute-killing politicians. And that is a good thing.

You probably like trees just as much as the next person, but there’s no way you like them as much as Tolkien did.

Will Amazon Change 'Lord of the Rings'? Prequels Deal Creates Questions,2017-11-13T19:54:00Z,"J.R.R. Tolkien’s visionary high fantasy series The Lord of the Rings is officially coming to TV. What can lifelong fans expect?

Amazon announced Monday that it has officially landed the rights to J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings series.

The interesting thing about this unprecedentedly large and expensive deal — which industry observers have characterized “insane” — is that Amazon seems to have gained access to every bit of the Tolkien Middle-earth library.

What Does Amazon Get?

Amazon has access to the original Lord of the Rings trilogy, the prequel The Hobbit, the entirety of The Silmarillion, and everything else Middle-earth. The possibilities are numerous, and Amazon announced the deal “includes a potential additional spin-off series,” similarly to how HBO has been developing several Game of Thrones spin-offs.

“New Lord of the Rings Storylines”

According to Amazon, “the television adaptation will explore new storylines preceding J.R.R. Tolkien’s The Fellowship of the Ring,” which could technically mean a lot of things. Early speculation that Amazon would attempt to reboot Peter Jackson’s movie trilogy doesn’t seem to be the case anymore.

Giphy

The word “preceding” indicates that the series will start right before the events of The Fellowship of the Ring, the first book in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Perhaps the first season will follow Strider (aka Aragorn, heir of Isildur and the rightful King of Gondor) or further detail Frodo Baggins’ life in the Shire before Gandalf’s arrival.

Maybe “preceding” just indicates anything before the original trilogy, which might mean a live-action adaptation of the entirety of The Silmarillion or even just a singular story from it (including The Tale of Beren and Lúthien).

Will Amazon make an anthology series that slowly explores the wonders of Middle-earth, or will audiences get a detailed narrative that winds through multiple seasons and ends right as The Fellowship of the Ring begins?

“We are delighted that Amazon, with its longstanding commitment to literature, is the home of the first-ever multi-season television series for The Lord of the Rings,” Matt Galsor, a representative for the Tolkien Estate and Trust and HarperCollins, said in the statement. “Sharon [Tal Yguado, Amazon’s head of scripted series] and the team at Amazon Studios have exceptional ideas to bring to the screen previously unexplored stories based on J.R.R. Tolkien’s original writings.”

The series will be available to watch via Amazon Prime, Amazon’s streaming service.

There are still new episodes of Pixar's Win or Lose coming this month, as well as the premiere of David Blaine Do Not Attempt. Unfortunately, once Born Again, Win or Lose, and David Blaine Do Not Attempt are counted, there just isn't much new programming left to watch in March.

Our roundup of everything new on Disney+ in March 2025 can be found below, with our favorites highlighted in bold.

Viola Davis Attached To Star In ‘The Fighting Shirley Chisholm’ For Amazon Studios,2018-11-29T17:01:46Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Days after Oscar winner Viola Davis and Julius Tennon’s JuVee Productions announced a first look feature production deal with Amazon Studios, the first project is moving forward: The Fighting Shirley Chisholm in which Davis will produce and star as the U.S. Representative who was both the first woman and the first person of color to seek a major American political party’s nomination for President.

Maggie Betts BEP

Amazon studios acquired the title in what we understand was a fierce bidding war, with Homegrown Pictures’ Stephanie Allain (Hustle & Flow, Dear White People) and Mel Jones producing with JuVee. Maggie Betts (Novitiate) will direct the screenplay written by Emmy-nominated writer Adam Countee (Silicon Valley, Community, Mindy Project).

Countee had long been interested in telling Chisholm’s story and his research led him to write the feature script on spec about the trailblazing congresswoman who never backed down as her bid drew ridicule and bigoted backlash. Chisholm ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1968 from New York’s 12th congressional district and became the first black woman elected to Congress. In January 1972 she announced her presidential bid in a Baptist church in her Brooklyn district. That election ended with George McGovern getting the Democratic nomination and losing to incumbent Republican President Richard Nixon.

Watch on Deadline

Davis can currently be seen starring in the critically acclaimed Widows from director Steve McQueen and stars in Amazon Studio’s Troupe Zero, alongside Alison Janney and Jim Gaffigan. Davis won an Oscar for her supporting role in Denzel Washington’s feature adaptation of August Wilson’s Fences in 2017 in addition to a Golden Globe and SAG award for her performance. She won a drama Primetime Emmy in 2015 for her lead actress role in ABC/Shondaland’s How to Get Away With Murder. Davis is the first black actress to be nominated for three Oscars, and one of the few to have an Emmy, Oscar and Tony Award win.

Davis is repped by CAA, Lasher Group and Lichter, Grossman, Nichols, Adler & Feldman Inc. Betts is repped by CAA and Brillstein Entertainment Partners. Homegrown Pictures is repped by UTA, Artists First and Jackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner & Klein. Countee is repped by UTA and 3Arts. Homegrown is dedicated to creating content by and about women and people of color with authentic stories, depictions and representation with the company amassing more than 100 award nominations with wins from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Film Independent Spirit Awards, Sundance Film Festival, the NAACP and more.",https://deadline.com/2018/11/viola-davis-the-fighting-shirley-chisholm-amazon-studios-movie-1202510762/
Why Do We Still Trust Amazon? How Big Tech Giants Fail to Protect Society,2018-11-24T23:00:00Z,"Amazon may have been expecting lots of public attention when it announced where it would establish its new headquarters — but like many technology companies recently, it probably didn’t anticipate how negative the response would be. In Amazon’s chosen territories of New York and Virginia, local politicians balked at taxpayer-funded enticements promised to the company. Journalists across the political spectrum panned the deals — and social media filled up with the voices of New Yorkers and Virginians pledging resistance.

Similarly, revelations that Facebook exploited anti-Semitic conspiracy theories to undermine its critics’ legitimacy indicate that instead of changing, Facebook would rather go on the offensive. Even as Amazon and Apple saw their stock-market values briefly top $1 trillion, technology executives were dragged before Congress, struggled to coherently take a stance on hate speech, got caught covering up sexual misconduct, and saw their own employees protesting business deals.

In some circles this is being seen as a loss of public trust in the technology firms that promised to remake the world — socially, environmentally, and politically — or at least as frustration with the way these companies have changed the world. But the technology companies need to do much more than regain the public’s trust; they need to prove that they deserved it in the first place — which, when placed in the context of the history of technology criticism and skepticism, they didn’t.

Looking Away From the Problems

Big technology companies used to frame their projects in vaguely utopian, positive-sounding lingo that obscures politics and public policy, transcending partisanship and — conveniently — avoiding scrutiny. Google used to remind its workers: “Don’t be evil.” Facebook worked to “make the world more open and connected.” Who could object to those ideals?

Scholars warned about the dangers of platforms like these, long before many of their founders were even born. In 1970, social critic and historian of technology Lewis Mumford predicted that the goal of what he termed “computerdom” would be “to furnish and process an endless quantity of data, in order to expand the role and ensure the domination of the power system.” That same year a seminal essay by feminist thinker Jo Freeman warned about the inherent power imbalances that remained in systems that appeared to make everyone equal.

Similarly, in 1976, the computer scientist Joseph Weizenbaum predicted that in the decades ahead people would find themselves in a state of distress as they became increasingly reliant on opaque technical systems. Countless similar warnings have been issued ever since, including important recent scholarship such as information scholar Safiya Noble’s exploration of how Google searches replicate racial and gender biases and media scholar Siva Vaidhyanthan’s declaration that “the problem with Facebook is Facebook.”

The technology companies are powerful and wealthy, but their days of avoiding scrutiny may be ending. The American public seems to be starting to suspect that the technology giants were unprepared, and perhaps unwilling, to assume responsibility for the tools they unleashed upon the world.

In the aftermath of the 2016 US presidential election, concern remains high that Russian and other foreign governments are using any available social media platform to sow discord and discontent in societies around the globe.

Facebook has still not solved the problems in data privacy and transparency that caused the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Twitter is the preferred megaphone for President Donald Trump and home to disturbing quantities of violent hate speech. The future of Amazon’s corporate offices is shaping up to be a multi-sided brawl among elected officials and the people they supposedly represent.

Is It Ignorance or Naivete?

Viewing the present situation with the history of critiques of technology in mind, it’s hard not to conclude that the technology companies deserve the crises they are facing. These companies ask people to entrust them with their emails, personal data, online search histories, and financial information, to the point that many of these companies proudly tout that they know individuals better than they know themselves. They promote their latest systems, including “smart speakers” and “smart cameras,” seeking to ensure that users’ every waking moment — and sleeping moments too — can be monitored, feeding more data into their money-making algorithms.

Yet seemingly inevitably these companies go on to demonstrate how unworthy of trust they actually are, leaking data, sharing personal information, and failing to prevent hacking, as they slowly fill the world with a disturbing techno-paranoia worthy of an episode of “Black Mirror.”

Technology firms’ responses to each new revelation fit a standard pattern: After a scandal emerges, the company involved expresses alarm that anything went wrong, promises to investigate, and pledges to do better in the future. Some time — days, weeks, or even months — later, the company reveals that the scandal was a direct result of how the system was designed, and trots out a dismayed executive to express outrage at the destructive uses bad people found for their system, without admitting that the problem is the system itself.

Zuckerberg himself told the US Senate in April 2018 that the Cambridge Analytica scandal had taught him “we have a responsibility to not just give people tools, but to make sure that those tools are used for good.” That’s a pretty fundamental lesson to have missed out on while creating a multi-billion-dollar company.

Rebuilding From What’s Left

Using any technology — from a knife to a computer — carries risks, but as technological systems increase in size and complexity, the scale of these risks tends to increase as well. A technology is only useful if people can use it safely, in ways where the benefits outweigh the dangers, and if they can feel confident that they understand, and accept, the potential risks. A couple of years ago, Facebook, Twitter, and Google may have appeared to most people as benign communication methods that brought more to society than they took away. But with every new scandal, and bungled response, more and more people are seeing that these companies pose serious dangers to society.

As tempting as it may be to point to the “off” button, there’s not an easy solution. Technology giants have made themselves part of the fabric of daily life for hundreds of millions of people. Suggesting that people just quit is simple, but fails to recognize how reliant many people have become on these platforms — and how trapped they may feel in an increasingly intolerable situation.

As a result, people buy books about how bad Amazon is — by ordering them on Amazon. They conduct Google searches for articles about how much information Google knows about each individual user. They tweet about how much they hate Twitter and post on Facebook articles about Facebook’s latest scandal.

The technology companies may find themselves ruling over an increasingly aggravated user base, as their platforms spread the discontent farther and wider than possible in the past. Or they might choose to change themselves dramatically, breaking themselves up, turning some controls over to the democratic decisions of their users, and taking responsibility for the harm their platforms and products have done to the world. So far, though, it seems the industry hasn’t gone beyond offering half-baked apologies while continuing to go about business as usual. Hopefully that will change. But if the past is any guide, it probably won’t.

Apple Considering Low Cost Apple TV Dongle to Provide Wider Access to Upcoming Streaming Service,2018-11-21T21:30:41Z,"Apple is considering creating a lower-cost Apple TV dongle that's similar to the Amazon Fire Stick or the Google Chromecast, reports The Information.

Apple has held discussions about introducing such a product, which would be priced lower than the Apple TV and would be able to be plugged into the back of a television set.



The company is said to be contemplating such a hardware device to promote an upcoming streaming service that's in the works. A lower-cost Apple TV dongle would make the service, which will be available only on Apple devices, more accessible to potential buyers.

Right now, Apple's only television product is the Apple TV, priced at $179 for the Apple TV 4K and $149 for the non-4K version. Current TV dongles from Amazon and Google are priced much lower, at $25 to $35.

Rumors have suggested Apple is planning to roll out a streaming service next year, perhaps as early as March, and it is set to launch in more than 100 countries in 2019.

Apple may offer the streaming service on a standalone basis, or bundle it up with Apple Music and an Apple News subscription that includes Texture, the magazine service that it purchased.

Original television content created by Apple could be made available for free to iPhone, iPad, and Apple TV users through the TV app. Apple is also negotiating deals to provide access to subscription channels like HBO and STARZ.

For its streaming service, Apple has more than a dozen original television shows in the works, and it has inked deals with production companies for movies. A full list of all of the projects Apple has in the works right now can be found in our Apple TV roundup.",https://www.macrumors.com/2018/11/21/apple-tv-dongle-possible/
Google Home Hub vs. Amazon Echo Show vs. Facebook Portal: Price & Privacy,2018-10-09T16:24:00Z,"Google Home Hub made its debut on Tuesday in New York, showing what it can and won’t do, how it’s similar to Amazon’s Echo Show and the Facebook Portal. Notably, it’s different from the competition in one huge way that should please everyone who’s concerned with privacy.

Google executive Diya Jolly introduced the new product, taking care to describe it as an essential product for the thoughtful home, side-stepping the cliche of the “smart home” a few times during her remarks, compared to the just-revealed Facebook Portal and the second-generation Amazon Echo Show, Google Home Hub appears to be winning the competition for coziest home video tablet, based on its soft design, A.I. software, a focus on privacy, and kitchen-focused features.

The Google Home Hub sells for $149, it comes in four colors, and Google is throwing in six months of Youtube Premium — a $12/month service — for free.

Jolly said from the stage in Soho that she “obsessed” over Google Home Hub’s display, noting that it can respond automatically to the ambient light in the room because of a new feature called Ambient EQ, a sensor to fine-tune brightness and color of the display. Also, Hub automatically turns the screen off at night.

“No matter what time of day, which room, and even your home decor, Hub can blend seamlessly into your home,” Jolly said.

Google Home Hub: Where’s the Camera?

On Monday, Facebook debuted its Portal video tablet, which was roundly criticized here and other places by journalists who asked if debuting a video camera tablet now was the right time, given Facebook’s biggest data breach in history was uncovered just last month. It seems that Google might’ve forced Facebook’s hand, as the search giant put its rival video up for pre-order Monday. It ships in November.

Google’s Home Hub is different from its Amazon and Facebook competition in one big way: It doesn’t have a video camera. Both Amazon and Facebook tablets tout a camera as a way to make video calls.

Jolly noted that Google Home Hub’s designers did not include a camera, “so that it was comfortable to use in the private spaces of your home, like your bedroom.”

Google illustrated exactly why one might not want a camera in the Home Hub by showing one on a night stand, next to a woman waking up — at 7 a.m. Nobody should be hacked, but especially not then:

The other major player in the video screen market is, of course, Amazon, and reviews of the second-generation Amazon Echo Show came out on Monday, ahead of its October 11 release and the unveiling of the Google Home Hub on Tuesday.

Google Home Hub also acts as a video doorbell when used with Nest, setting up competition with Amazon and its Ring Doorbell tech.

More Google Home Hub Specs Announced Tuesday

Google Home Hub comes in four colors:

— “Aqua,” a seafoam green

— “Sand,” sort of a millennial pink

— “Charcoal,” it’s black

— “Chalk,” similar to heather gray

Google Home Hub has five primary functions:

— Search

— Youtube

— Google Maps

— Google Calendar

— Google Photos

Who’s the Best Jack Ryan? A Definitive Ranking of Tom Clancy Adaptations,2018-08-31T22:47:00Z,"Based on the Tom Clancy books your dad probably vaguely remembers, the Jack Ryan IP is a relic. The Ryanverse, which began with the first book, Patriot Games, in 1987, has had many permutations over the past 30 years. The movies featured Jack Ryan played by Harrison Ford, Alec Baldwin, Chris Pine, and Ben Affleck, and now with Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan, John Krasinski gives Ryan a go with Amazon Prime’s new television series.

Ryan — a history teacher, a Marine, a CIA agent, and, briefly, POTUS — is a more clever, more fiscally responsible everyman. But like James Bond, this character is part of an image of masculinity that now seems comically wholesome at best (Ford) and campy at worst (Baldwin).

In honor of the series coming to Amazon Prime this Friday, Inverse ranked the best Jack Ryan adaptations, spanning movies and video games because it took too long to get this stuff on TV.

Don't worry, John Krasinski, you'll be on the Jack Ryan list (from 'A Quiet Place'). Paramount Pictures

It’s yet to be seen where Krasinski fits in this mix, but once we watch, we’ll update this list.]

8. The Hunt for Red October (1987) Atari Video Game

I do remember this game, but only in the sense that I watched my dad played it and wished he would just fire up Doom or Duke Nukem instead; they were bloodier and way more fun to watch. I can’t give Hunt for Red October for the Atari a high score, partly because it’s based on the novel and partly because it’s a mouse-controlled submarine simulator.

This is Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan we’re talking about. He intimidates diplomats and analyzes data. We’re not telling stories about a guy who drives a freaking submarine.

7. The Hunt for Red October (1990) Super NES Classic Video Game

Oof, I wish Nintendo had waited and released this sucker for the Gameboy Advance. Why couldn’t a Jack Ryan game look like Pokémon Blue? This game also stuck to the whole underwater-submarine-battle set piece instead of getting into Ryan’s head, so it’ll fade into the annals of time.

6. Chris Pine in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit (2014)

This cringefest nearly toppled Pine off the Chris List, which in 2014 was a marketing ploy still in its infancy. A few years before, he had just knocked it out of the park as Captain Tiberius Kirk in JJ Abrams’ Star Trek, but this experiment felt bizarre. Probably because it was directed by Kenneth Branagh, who only seems to know how to tell stories about men in complex costumes.

The most memorable line in this movie is Pine’s “You Russians think of yourselves as poets but perhaps you’re just touchy.” Take that, you election-hacking elitists.

5. Ben Affleck in The Sum of All Fears (2002)

Ben Affleck’s combo of sex appeal and smarmy line delivery was at a fever pitch in 2002, just a few years after seducing Liv Tyler with animal crackers in Armageddon. But that’s the problem with the version from Phil Alden Robinson (Field of Dreams). Jack Ryan isn’t a sexy young loose cannon cop — not to millennials. He’s Action Dad to us all.

4. The Sum of All Fears Video Game (2002)

This game is definitely the best Jack Ryan video game adaptation, which isn’t saying all that much. But remember when a video game plot twist meant, like, another corner you had to turn around to shoot? No battle of the wits in this one either.

3. Harrison Ford in Patriot Games (1992)

Jack Ryan is the opposite of Batman, in that his origin story isn’t often recounted, and the viewer typically just drops in on a political adventure. So that’s exciting. Plus, in this one, a young Harrison Ford kills Sean Bean by impaling him on an anchor.

That should be enough to sell you on this fantastic punch-em-up romp, which is the first enjoyable movie on the list. Watch for Ford’s all-time action movie line delivery of “I’m not after your job, Marty. I’m after the man who tried to kill my family.”

2. Alec Baldwin in The Hunt for Red October (1990)

This one is a classic, the only Jack Ryan adaptation to rise above the goofiness and inject an auteur’s flair, but all the scenes you remember just involve Sean Connery, who snarls the name of his own boat deliciously. The stakes are comically high. A submarine and some arguing men control the fate of the world, and for that, Baldwin (but really Connery) gets a decent ranking.

1. Harrison Ford in Clear and Present Danger (1994)

The top movie on our list is Philip Noyce’s second Jack Ryan film, a sequel to Patriot Games and a Terminator 2-esque improvement on the original. Already alone and with nothing more to lose, Ryan takes his quest for good to a global scale, maturing from a hothead to an icy professional. The sequel also deftly adds Willem Dafoe as a begrudging ally and features hilarious dialogue like this:

Bob Ritter (Henry Czerny): Jack, computer theft is a serious crime.

Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford): (talking to himself) So are crimes against the Constitution.

If Krasinski’s turn as Ryan stands a chance when it’s available to stream Friday, it’ll have to recreate that that lightning in a bottle quality, the ‘90s alchemy of dad jokes, Boy Scout morality, and super simple hand-to-hand combat that makes the old movies so fun.",https://www.inverse.com/article/48599-ranking-all-tom-clancy-s-jack-ryan-adaptations
Z-Wave is making a huge change so it doesn’t get left behind in the smart home wars,2019-12-19T19:17:14Z,"When Apple, Google, Amazon, and Zigbee announced that they were going to work together on a common smart home standard yesterday, one huge name was missing: Z-Wave, a system meant for low-power smart devices like locks and lightbulbs.

The competing smart home system has long been criticized by rivals as not truly being an open standard — despite outward appearances otherwise — and it’s easy to imagine that’s why it was left out. So today, The Z-Wave Alliance is making an announcement that would seem to fix that. It’s going to open up a part of the standard that’s long been locked down as a money-making scheme, theoretically turning Z-Wave into a fully open rival.

“That seemed to have been the only objection I was always confronted with.”

Until now, a single company — which just happens to own and develop Z-Wave — has been responsible for providing all of the chips for Z-Wave radios. That means there’s no competition driving down prices, and if Z-Wave were to ever become truly dominant, that company, Silicon Labs, would be in a position to make a whole lot of money.

With today’s change, Silicon Labs is going to start letting other companies make Z-Wave radios, too. That addresses the biggest ongoing complaint with Z-Wave: that Silicon Labs (and Sigma Designs, which owned Z-Wave for years before it) effectively had control over the entire ecosystem.

“I would acknowledge that that seemed to have been the only objection I was always confronted with,” Mitchell Klein, executive director of the Z-Wave Alliance, said on a call with The Verge.

The goal is to eventually turn Z-Wave into a completely open standard. Even the Z-Wave Alliance — an apparent standards body, which seems to mostly be in charge of certifying device compatibility — will be spun out into a fully independent organization in charge of developing Z-Wave, rather than existing as part of Silicon Labs. More details about the spinoff will be announced in “the forthcoming months,” Klein said.

The Z-Wave Alliance will be spun out of into an independent organization

That would turn Silicon Labs into just one company among many that are trying to make money off of Z-Wave. That might seem like a strange decision just a couple of years after buying the Z-Wave business for $240 million, but it’s a risk that makes somewhat more sense under Silicon Labs than it would have under prior owners.

Silicon Labs’ main business is selling radios for all kinds of smart devices, including those that work with competing connectivity systems. Its radios are inside Philips Hue lightbulbs, Ikea Tradfri products, Ring’s alarm system, and even Amazon’s Echo Plus, says Johan Pedersen, Silicon Labs’ manager of smart home marketing. With an already successful radio business — and the only Z-Wave radio business around at this point — Silicon Labs thinks it’ll be able to compete just fine with other entrants.

The hope is that, by opening Z-Wave up, adoption will expand. If Z-Wave becomes more popular, more radios will be needed, and Silicon Labs will be best positioned to sell them. Already, the company says it’s run into hurdles making sales because of the closed system because many security providers won’t buy anything they can’t source from multiple vendors.

“We see these two big initiatives being complementary to each other.”

Silicon Labs may also have seen the direction things were heading. In recent years, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi have become more common options for smart home devices (even though their higher power requirements put them at a disadvantage in many cases), and Zigbee has been successful with lower-power devices like lights that Z-Wave would traditionally aim for.

With the announcement from Apple, Google, Amazon, and Zigbee yesterday — forming a group known as Connected Home over IP — Silicon Labs may have realized Z-Wave was starting to get left behind. While that new group isn’t developing a competing radio communications standard that would replace Z-Wave, it is going to try to establish a system that smart home devices can all use to connect with one another. If it works out, those devices, which will primarily rely on Bluetooth and Wi-Fi at first, are likely to take off among consumers, leaving less room for Z-Wave.

But ultimately, Silicon Labs just wants to sell radios, and both announcements are really about making smart home tech more accessible. Z-Wave may not be involved in Connected Home over IP, but Silicon Labs is. (It’s mentioned in the announcement as a board member of Zigbee that will contribute to the project.)",https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/19/21029661/zwave-open-standard-radios-smart-home-multiple-vendors-silicon-labs
Amazon's Echo Show 8 is the perfect size,2019-12-19T12:14:43Z,"Amazon’s Echo Show 8 is the perfect size for someone who wants to place a smart display in a common space in their home.

Amazon has released two smart display sizes before, the tiny Echo Show 5 and the large Echo Show 10. Now, there’s a model that sits between these two, and I think it’s a perfect size.

I find the Show 10 is too big for most spaces and the Show 5 is too small to work outside of the bedroom.

The Show 8, on the other hand, hits the size sweet spot, making it perfect for common areas in your home.

What sets this apart

The eight-inch smart display is very similar to the Show 5 in terms of looks and hardware, but there are a few differences.

Unlike the Echo Show 5, the Show 8 has no shortcomings when it comes to sound quality. It’s packing a pair of two-inch speakers that push out 10-watts of sound each. In my time with the device, it could get loud and had no problem filling my apartment with music.

The screen is also very sharp compared to the Show 5. This time Amazon built-in a 1280 x 800 resolution display and it looks excellent.

Since the screen is larger, it’s a better digital picture frame too. You can load in your own photos with the Amazon Photos app, or use one of the company’s pre-set wallpaper packs. I’m a big fan of the ‘Art’ slideshow.

To my touch, the Show 8 feels more responsive than the sometimes laggy Show 5, which is a much-needed improvement.

This also makes the smart speaker a better smart home controller compared to the 5. A simple swipe in from the right opens up a control panel where you can start playing music, communicate with other Echos and control smart home devices.

Overall there isn’t anything wrong with this device, but it just feels like a bigger, louder and faster Echo Show 5, which is a good thing.

For many people, I can see this being their main Alexa interface because it’s so good and doesn’t have many drawbacks.

If you’re interested in the Show 8, I’d recommend you read our Show 5 review to get a better sense of how the smart displays work, but overall I’d say get a Show 5 if you want it in a bedroom or sitting on an office desk. If you want the device in your kitchen or living room, the Show 8 is likely a better bet.

You can buy the Echo Show 8 regularly from Amazon for $169.99. Currently, it’s on sale for $89.",https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/12/19/amazon-echo-show-8-review/
Amazon's Echo Flex lets you put Alexa nearly anywhere,2019-12-19T00:03:04Z,"First and foremost, the Echo Flex is for people who live in an Alexa-based household and want to take their setup to the next level.

The Echo Flex enables a few neat smart home tricks, but its main benefit is that it easily and cheaply adds Alexa nearly anywhere.

What is this for?

If you want a tiny Alexa in your garage or workshop, plug this into a wall and you’re good to go. It even has a headphone jack so you could plug it into a larger pair of speakers to stream multi-room audio there.

Another good use case would be in your laundry room so you can set timers easily. There’s also a USB-A port on the bottom of the device. This means that if it’s plugged in near your bed, it’s capable of charging your phone.

If you want Alexa in a single room and you’re worried you won’t use it often or only need it for a single task, the Flex is perfect.

It’s cheaper than the Dot and way more functional than the currently unavailable Echo Input.

That’s what the Flex does on a base level, and in my tests, it does this well. Its speaker isn’t super loud, but for most people, that won’t be an issue since it likely won’t be used as a standalone music device.

Beyond the basic use cases, the USB port on the bottom of the device can also enable a few third-party attachments. So far, there’s only a motion sensor and a night light.

The motion sensor is handy because you can set it up to trigger your smart lights. This means if you have one by your front door every time you walk into your home, the lights come on. The night light is just a voice-controlled night light.

I was unable to test these in my home, but at a recent Amazon event, they both worked well. The automation that the motion sensor adds to the package makes it an excellent smart home addition.

Hardware

The Flex’s hardware is super sturdy and tiny, which is just about perfect for what it’s used for. I would have liked a black colour option to match some parts of my home, but white isn’t awful by any means.

It features a tiny light at the top that works just like it does on other Echo products. It turns blue when listening, yellow when you have a notification and so on. On either side of the light are two microphone ports. Below is the ‘Action’ button, the ‘Mute’ button and the speaker.

The right side houses the 3.5mm audio jack. The bottom is where the USB port is, while the back has the outlet prongs so it can jack into a wall plug.

What would have been great is if Amazon had made this into a smart plug as well as an Echo so it could control other devices. Either way, it’s still a handy device and should help people interact with Alexa in more and more places.

In Canada, the Flex retails for $34.99 regularly. Both the attachments cost $14.",https://mobilesyrup.com/2019/12/18/amazon-echo-flex-alexa-review/

"Apple, Amazon, Google, and Zigbee Alliance to Develop Open Standard for Smart Home Devices [Updated]",2019-12-18T13:06:31Z,"Apple, Amazon, Google, and the Zigbee Alliance today announced a new working group that plans to develop and promote the adoption of a new IP-based connectivity standard for smart home products, with a focus on increased compatibility, security, and simplified development for manufacturers.



Zigbee Alliance board member companies such as IKEA, Legrand, NXP Semiconductors, Resideo, SmartThings, Schneider Electric, Signify, Silicon Labs, Somfy, and Wulian will also contribute to the project.

The so-called ""Project Connected Home over IP"" aims to make it easier for device manufacturers to build devices that are compatible with smart home and voice services such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and others by defining a specific set of IP-based networking technologies for device certification.

The new standard will incorporate existing smart home technologies, such as Apple's HomeKit and Google's Weave and Thread:

We're contributing two of our market-tested and open-source smart home technologies, Weave and Thread. Both are built on IP and have been integrated into millions of homes around the world. Weave, an application protocol, works over many networks like Thread, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth Low Energy, and even cellular. Even when devices are on different networks, Weave allows them all to securely work with each other.

The new connectivity standard will be open source and royalty free, with code to be maintained on GitHub. The working group has a goal to release a draft specification and a preliminary reference implementation in late 2020.

For consumers, this should ultimately lead to more smart home accessories that support multiple platforms like HomeKit and Alexa.

Update: Resideo, maker of Honeywell-branded smart home products, has announced that it has joined the Zigbee Alliance. Alongside other members, Resideo will play a role in the Connected Home over IP project.",https://www.macrumors.com/2019/12/18/apple-amazon-google-zigbee-open-standard/
Ted Bundy Falling For a Killer Trailer,2019-12-12T23:30:41Z,"Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile dramatized the relationship between serial killer Ted Bundy and girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall. Now, Ted Bundy: Falling for a Killer will tell that story with a more intimate perspective, as Kendall herself sits down for the first time in nearly 40 years to talk about her experiences with Bundy. Here's the synopsis:

Ted Bundy: Falling for a Killer is a five-part docuseries that reframes infamous serial killer Ted Bundy's crimes from a female perspective, uncovering the disturbing and profound way in which his pathological hatred of women collided with the culture wars and feminist movement of the 1970s, culminating in what is perhaps the most infamous true crime saga of our time.

The series is anchored by the story of Bundy's longtime girlfriend Elizabeth Kendall and her daughter Molly, who, after nearly 40 years of silence, are sharing their experiences with new unsettling details about Bundy, the inconceivable pull he had on women, and an abundant archive of never-before-seen family photos.

They are joined by a chorus of female voices, including survivors of Bundy's attacks – some of whom are stepping forward for the first time – with chilling accounts that will forever change the Bundy narrative and provoke a discussion around gender politics that hauntingly resonates today.

Even after all these years, Bundy's story continues to fascinate us and pique our morbid curiosity. But Falling for a Killer definitely sounds unique in that it's presenting Bundy almost entirely from a female perspective. In addition To Kendall, the series features interviews with Barbara Grossman, a reporter at KUTV Salt Lake City; Kathleen McChesney, a detective for the King County Sheriff's Department in Seattle; Py Bateman, founder of the Feminist Karate Union at the University of Washington; Phyllis Armstrong, a student at the University of Washington and friend of Bundy victim Georgann Hawkins; Molly Kendall, Elizabeth Kendall's daughter; Karen Sparks, a survivor who is believed to be Bundy's first victim; Polly Nelson, one of Bundy's post-conviction lawyers; and Laura Healy, sister to Bundy victim Lynda Healy.

"MUBI joins Hotstar, Netflix, Amazon Prime in India's OTT space",2019-12-06T05:29:17Z,"India is a poster child for internet adoption, and over-the-top (OTT) platforms are banking on that.

There was a time when a couple of large platforms enjoyed a near-monopoly over the Indian OTT market. But now, as the number of internet users have increased, so have these content offerings. The latest international player to join this universe is MUBI, a London-based curated streaming service founded in 2007.

Advertisement

With an India-specific channel and subscription plan, MUBI’s launch on Nov. 16, could possibly herald a change in viewing habits among OTT viewers in the country. Unlike Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, EROS Now, and Hotstar that offer an ever-increasing collection of films and TV series, MUBI handpicks films and puts up one recommendation a day. “We make our films available on MUBI in a way that doesn’t overwhelm or frustrate people,” Efe Cakarel, founder and CEO of MUBI, told Quartz India.

Other than the curated list of films, the genre of films available on MUBI also sets it apart from other OTT platforms. The films on the platform are generally arthouse cinema, documentaries, or short films, that are guided by the local culture of the country that cinema represents. Rarely do mainstream feature films, especially in terms of the most direct understanding of Bollywood, appear on the list of MUBI’s curation. The only exception in the Indian context is perhaps Andaz Apna Apna, which is a cult unto itself.

In a unique partnership with PVR Cinemas, MUBI also announced the MUBI GO programme on Nov. 27. Under this, MUBI subscribers will be able to redeem one ticket for a “film of the week” at any PVR hall that is screening it. This could be an interesting game-changer, especially in terms of bringing more audiences to watch films that often go unnoticed. MUBI is currently available for Rs199 for the first three months, and Rs499 per month subsequently.

In an interview with Quartz, Cakarel talks about the competitive OTT market in India, working with Indian filmmakers, and how MUBI plans to ensure people don’t get bored with its platform. Edited excerpts:

Advertisement

Are you worried that MUBI is entering India at a time when there are various homegrown and international OTT players crowding the market?

Our model and approach are very different from other SVoD (subscription video on demand) services, and we don’t see MUBI as having to directly compete with other streaming apps. We know, through research, that many people will subscribe to more than one SVoD service, so consumers in India could subscribe to both Netflix and MUBI.

We are focused first and foremost on human curation, and we have built a service that concentrates on the highest quality and attention to detail, that will speak to anyone with a genuine love for great films.

We introduce one new hand-picked film a day, chosen by film experts who look at local culture and cinema to decide what people would enjoy watching in that market. But in India, following the launch of MUBI India and MUBI World, we now offer two new films a day.

Advertisement

Another key differentiator for us is MUBI GO, a partnership with PVR Cinemas that we announced last month. No other streaming service has partnered with a cinema chain like this in India before, and the response since we announced has been really positive.

A lot of OTT players are going the “originals” way. Will MUBI ever go beyond curation to creating its own content in India?

Yes, definitely, and we can’t wait to start producing in India. Our production team is already reviewing treatments and scripts from Indian filmmakers. We’re currently producing in the US and Europe—we have Port Authority, which debuted at Cannes this year in the Un Certain Regard section, Rachel Lang’s Mon Legionnaire, and the recently announced TV series, Maniac Cop, from Nicolas Winding Refn. There are more projects that we are involved in, which we will be able to talk more about next year.

Advertisement

What brought you to India, and what went behind putting together MUBI’s offering here?

Towards the end of 2017, the global investment firm Times Bridge approached us as they had spotted a huge potential in MUBI, seeing us as a company that has a unique and successful business model, and over 10 years of proven appeal amongst our subscribers.

India was MUBI’s third-largest market in terms of traffic and registered users at the point we started speaking with Times Bridge, but our long-term plan was to grow even further in India and develop a bespoke MUBI experience that would appeal to subscribers there. And to engage this audience we really needed to understand them and the media landscape, meet film producers, partner with local festivals, and much more to succeed there.

We agreed that Times Bridge was an ideal partner to do this with and in January 2018 officially announced the partnership. This year we’ve expanded the local team in Mumbai and built partnerships with some of India’s leading distributors including PVR Pictures, Ultra, Shemaroo, FilmKaravan, and NFDC. All of which has helped us with content to curate our newly launched MUBI India and MUBI World channels.

How did you zero in on filmmaker Guneet Monga for curating the India channel? What does she bring to the table?

Guneet was introduced to MUBI through Times Bridge. She had been a fan of MUBI for a long time and understood our origins well, so we started discussing how she could support our plans for India.

Guneet’s energy, knowledge, and passion for film is the exact premise that MUBI was founded on and we’re very honoured to work with her given her accomplishments in the industry and the vast network of people she has collaborated with.

Indian films in the arthouse genre rarely do well commercially. Do you feel there’s an audience in India for such cinema?

Advertisement

There is and we speak to them every day. It has become even clearer over the past few weeks that people want to watch more Indian cinema, particularly independent films, and they are delighted with the introduction of MUBI INDIA and the films we have selected. Nazar, Ganashastru, Agantuk, and Kamla Ki Maut are proving very popular right now. We’ve seen worldwide demand for MUBI India, too, so we are currently looking at how we can hero Indian cinema in other markets.

The other peril of having just critically acclaimed films is keeping people interested. How do you plan to retain your user’s attention through filmmaking that is not typically “escapist” or meant to be “chilled” with?

MUBI is for people that want to see beautiful, interesting and incredible films that they may not be able to find anywhere else or may not have even heard of before.

We don’t only support and pick films that have been critically acclaimed either, we select documentaries, shorts and feature films, alongside the world-renowned titles we feel are brilliant films that need to be watched. It’s difficult to say which films people watch to relax with as everyone is different but the perception that every film on MUBI is “challenging” isn’t the case. Some days we may have The Breakfast Club as the film of the day, other days the selection could be harder hitting like M, or Bix Travesty, which is on MUBI World now.

We realise that not every person will enjoy every film we select, but we like that we’re introducing new films to people every day that they may not have ever discovered if it wasn’t for MUBI.",https://qz.com/india/1760317/mubi-joins-hotstar-netflix-amazon-prime-in-indias-ott-space/
Simon Cowell faces stiff competition in ratings war as Amazon signs up BGT stars,2020-12-31T20:30:00Z,"Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info

Former Britain’s Got Talent stars are fronting a rival show to try and topple Simon Cowell in a ratings war.

Previous BGT winners Richard Jones and George Sampson, as well as X Factor champion Sam Bailey have been snapped up as judges for the new show.

Called Now That’s Entertainment, it will air on Amazon Prime who are determined to capitalise on BGT’s family audience to secure big ratings.

A source said: “Amazon and the producers are hellbent on making this show a huge hit. BGT is a ratings giant so it’s little wonder they have raided their former stable for stars to be judges.”

The show has already run on Amazon Prime but without any big celeb names.

The source added: “It was received so well they decided to up the ante and just go for it with some well-known talent and really push the boat out.

“Cowell will be nervously looking over his shoulder to see if they can make it a success but all the signs are there it can be.”

"Worcester Board Approves Amazon Facility, Despite Opposition",2020-12-31T20:02:20Z,"Worcester's planning board has approved a site plan for the proposed demolition and redevelopment of the Greendale Mall as an Amazon ""last mile"" distribution center, despite concerns from neighbors about traffic, environmental impacts and noise.

Board members on Wednesday said they didn't want to invalidate neighborhood concerns, but they could only consider a narrow range of factors defined by the site plan review process, according to The Telegram & Gazette.

Board members and city planning officials reminded residents the online retail giant's proposed distribution center is allowed under zoning rules.

Amazon is launching a new shared network called Sidewalk, letting some people with its products know they'd been opted in to the program automatically.

Amazon officials have said the site is scheduled to come online in late 2022 or early 2023.

Opponents of the facility said Amazon has misled other communities where it has built similar facilities about traffic impacts in particular. Residents took issue with Amazon's traffic estimates, which include 18 tractor-trailer trips overnight.

Residents said that could increase to 30 at peak holiday times.

Jessica Schumer, an Amazon representative, said the 30 or so truck trips cited as peak holiday traffic would be about capacity for the site and any more demand would not be pushed through the site.",https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/worcester-board-approves-amazon-facility-despite-opposition/2269717/
'Too big to care': 2020 was the year that Europe got serious about tackling Big Tech,2020-12-31T19:30:00Z,"“THERE IS A feeling in Brussels that online platforms have become too big to care”.

This quote from Thierry Breton, EU Commissioner for the Internal Market, became ubiquitous in 2020; a year in which powerful, money-spinning American companies like Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook became even more profitable and influential.

In the past decade, regulators like EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager have launched numerous probes into anti-competitive practices by US companies.

Billions of euros of fines have been levied against most of the tech giants in the process.

But despite hefty financial penalties, policymakers say that abuses are still rife within European digital markets — costing consumers, not to mention European businesses, dearly.

This fact was remarked upon by the European Court of Auditors in a November report.

It gave the distinct impression that EU regulators had, to a large extent, been chasing their tails when it comes to enforcing competition rules on Silicon Valley companies.

The auditors highlighted that between 2010 and 2019, the Commission imposed some €28.5 billion in fines against companies for various breaches.

“While the level of the fines imposed by the Commission is among the highest in the world,” the ECA said, lawmakers have not been able to evaluate whether they have had anything like a deterrent effect upon these businesses.

New rules

It might have gotten slightly lost in the Brexit furore but the European Commission unveiled two landmark pieces of legislation in early December — the first major overhaul of European tech rules in over a decade.

Legal experts say the Digital Markets Act (DMA) and the Digital Services Act (DSA) represent a tactical shift in the bloc’s approach to regulating Big Tech.

Combined, the proposed laws create a new framework for enforcement.

The DSA takes aim at tech companies over illegal material and disinformation posted on their platforms. It puts a greater onus on them to police content, improve transparency around advertising and give watchdog groups and regulators access to internal data.

If they fail to follow the new rules, companies can be fined up to 6% of their annual revenue.

Meanwhile, the DMA is aimed at tackling thorny competition issues.

Chiefly, the act is concerned with mega-corporations like, for example, Amazon and how they act as ‘digital gatekeepers’ — guarding access to the market but also competing with merchants who use their platform to sell their own products.

For failing to comply with the new rules, the EU will be allowed to levy fines of up to 10% of the company’s total worldwide annual turnover and “periodic penalty payments” of up to 5%.

Crucially, it also means the Commission can order tech outfits to sell off parts of their business “where necessary to achieve compliance”.

But this the EU we’re talking about and it could take two years for the new framework to clear the legislative process.

In 2020, the EU was still playing with a weakened hand. Even still, however, regulators made some significant decisions this year and started the clock fresh antitrust investigations.

In some ways, it could be seen as the year that Europe got serious about tackling Big Tech. Here are some of the highlights:

Amazon

It’s an understatement to say that the global e-commerce giant was everywhere in 2020.

While most ‘brick and mortar’ retailers faltered, Amazon’s market valuation skyrocketed this year to something ridiculous like $1.6 trillion, cementing founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos’ status as the world’s richest man.

Neither strikes, nor legal actions by France’s biggest trade union nor scandals over employee welfare at its warehouses — where, in the US alone more than 20,000 workers have tested positive for Covid-19 — have managed to slow Amazon’s roll.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos cemented his status as the world's richest man in 2020 SIPA USA / PA Images SIPA USA / PA Images / PA Images

The online retail behemoth generated $128 billion from sales this year and a further $40 billion through its cloud services operation. And that’s before you add in the $68.6 billion generated by third-party merchants who use Amazon as a platform to sell their products.

But on both sides of the Atlantic, the winds of regulatory change have started to blow in Amazon’s face.

In November, the European Commission announced a set of formal charges against the Bezos-front company over alleged breaches of EU competition law. It followed a nearly two-year investigation.

At issue, is whether or not the company’s dual role within the online retail space as both a platform for third-party sellers and a seller of goods in its own right gives Amazon an unfair market advantage.

A preliminary investigation by the Commission found that Amazon employees have huge access to non-public data generated by sellers who use the platform.

It then uses this information, according to the Commission’s charges, to tailor its own retail offerings. Regulators came to the “preliminary view” that these practices allow the company “to avoid the normal risks of retail competition and to leverage its dominance in the market”.

Amazon faces a potential fine as high as 10% of its global turnover if it is found guilty of breaching competition law — about $19bn.

Google

In many ways, the European Union’s ongoing skirmish with Google over regulatory issues is emblematic of its struggle to deal with the power of Big Tech generally.

In November, when an auditor’s report broadly criticised the bloc’s efforts to curb the dominance of these massive corporations, it probably had Google in mind specifically.

Despite saddling the search engine giant with billions of euros in fines for breaches of competition law over the past ten years, little has changed. In fact, Google is still appealing a €2.4 billion levied against it by the commission in 2017 over certain behaviours including its preferential treatment of its own Google Shopping product over other, smaller competing platforms.

It’s hoped that the new Digital Markets Act will allow European regulators to subject companies like Google to stricter rules, labelling them as marketplace gatekeepers and subjecting them to new, ‘before-the-fact’ rules and obligations.

However, the Commission did launch a fresh probe into a specific bit of business that Google did last year: its €1.8 billion purchase of Fitbit.

In August, Vestager said, “Our investigation aims to ensure that control by Google over data collected through wearable devices as a result of the transaction does not distort competition.”

What the Commission was trying to establish is whether or not buying the company and its user data would allow Google to unfairly fortify its already strong position within the smartwatch market. Concerns were also raised that the purchase would strengthen Google’s dominance in digital advertising, increasing the “already vast” store of user data it can use to target ads.

But the investigation concluded in mid-December with the Commission granting Google the all-clear, subject to a few conditions and commitments by the company.

“We can approve the proposed acquisition of Fitbit by Google because the commitments will ensure that the market for wearables and the nascent digital health space will remain open and competitive,” said Vestager in December.

The commitments will determine how Google can use the data collected for ad purposes, how interoperability between competing wearables and Android will be safeguarded and how users can continue to share health and fitness data, if they choose to.

Facebook

This year, on the other side of the Atlantic, Facebook was one of the biggest antitrust lawsuits in American history.

It’s aim? To curb Facebook’s dominance and possibly even unwind some of its major acquisitions like WhatsApp and Instagram.

In Europe, things are moving a bit more slowly.

Last year, the Commission launched a two-pronged probe into alleged breaches of competition law by the social media giant. Focused on whether Facebook is distorting the classified ads market by promoting its free ‘Marketplace’ feature to users, that investigation was reportedly slowed down in the first half of the year by the pandemic.

Mark Zuckerberg's company is facing intense regulatory scrutiny on both sides of the Atlantic DPA / PA Images DPA / PA Images / PA Images

During the summer, Facebook slowed things down even more.

The company — through one of its Irish entities — sued the Commission investigators over “the exceptionally broad nature” of their orders to hand over certain internal documents and information, winning a temporary reprieve from having to hand over the data.

A full hearing in the General Court of the EU in October ended in a kind of stalemate.

The investigation can proceed but, as Bloomberg reported at the time, “the European Commission can’t force the social network giant to hand over potentially sensitive records without a detailed review.

Instead, the EU must work with Facebook in identifying such information and store it in a ‘virtual data room.’

To cap off a dramatic year, Facebook moved to wind down two of its Irish holding companies used to channel billions of euros of profits through the controversial ‘double Irish’ tax loophole.

That structure was formally abolished last January. In February, Facebook’s the US Internal Revenue Service is pursuing the company for $9 billion in unpaid taxes over its decision to move its profits to Ireland in 2010.

Interesting times for the Zuckerberg-fronted tech giant.

Apple

At long last, there was some movement in the long-running Apple tax case.

In July, the General Court of the European Union ruled that the iPhone maker will not have to hand back €13 billion in unpaid taxes to the Irish taxpayer.

It’s an important milestone in the saga that began in 2014 when the Commission launched an investigation into two Irish tax rulings that it eventually concluded provided “illegal tax benefits” to the tech giant.

Naturally, the decision was broadly welcomed in Irish political circles.

But as Sinn Féin finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty said at the time, “this is only halftime” in the row.

In September, the Commission appealed the landmark decision to the highest court in the EU, which could take between 18 months and two years to deliver a final decision.

Experts believe it unlikely that the decision will be fully overturned. It is, however, possible that elements of the ruling could be reversed but the initial judgment was certainly a black eye for Vestager, who is starting to run out of tools to tackle alleged tax avoidance by the giants of Silicon Valley.

Separately, the Commission in June launched two investigations into how Apple operates its App Store.

Like Amazon, regulators are concerned by the companies ‘gatekeeper’ role in digital markets, particularly around music streaming.

It follows a 2019 complaint by Swedish streaming platform Spotify that Apple uses its dominant position to limit consumer choice and promote its own Apple music service.

A similar complaint by Japanese company Rakuten about Apple’s conduct within the e-books market resulted in a second investigation by the Commission.

A withering public response from Apple took aim at “baseless complaints” made by “a handful of companies who simply want a free ride”.",https://www.thejournal.ie/eu-antitrust-big-tech-5313787-Dec2020/

"After 'Not Amazon' buoys local retail, restaurants unite in hope of New Year's boost",2020-12-31T18:55:38Z,"Toronto restaurateur Erik Joyal knew that his restaurants would need to do something different this New Year's Eve as the COVID-19 pandemic crashed everyone's party plans.

Seeing his fellow restaurateurs promoting prix fixe party boxes, meal kits, champagne flutes, and other creative New Year's celebrations, he decided to help organize an online show to boost visibility for small, independent business owners.

""I own three restaurants, a bar and a catering business. And so we thought to ourselves, what are we going to do?"" says Joyal. ""And then it just sort of morphed into, 'Well, maybe we should be thinking on a bigger level — with all the restaurants.""

As the COVID-19 pandemic limits New Year's Eve festivities, restaurants are banding together online in hopes that a ""shop local"" mentality can save the once-lucrative holiday for eateries.

One online event, Save Hospitality's NYE 2021 Big Night In, has built a database of about two hundred restaurants across the country. The event website has at least one listing for local restaurants in every province and territory.

A $19.95 ticket to the event gets buyers into an 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. online stream of performances by Canadian musicians. Joyal says virtual attendees allocate $5 from each ticket to a participating restaurant of their choice, which do not have to pay to be listed on the event's website and can also get extra donations from ticket sales.

Before COVID-19, regional food and event blogs would publish lists of New Year's Eve events in their region, but there was never much of a national restaurant alliance around the holiday, says Joyal.

But since the pandemic began, several groups of former restaurant rivals have banded together for events like Canada Takeout Day. Some cities, like Vaughan, Ont., even have government-run directories for local diners.

Toronto entrepreneur Robert Frier started his online directory of local restaurants, EatingYYZ, after the pandemic busted his businesses at street fairs and casinos.

Websites like Eating YYZ and Save Hospitality come as other organizers across the country have launched similar campaigns in other industries. Not-Amazon.ca, a list of local retailers, gained popularity during the holiday shopping season.

While the key shopping rush is winding down for those retailers, restaurants must still recover sorely-missed revenue from this year's dearth of New Year's pub crawls — in a year where Restaurants Canada estimates 188,000 restaurant jobs were lost.

An online survey of 1,091 adults by the Tourism Industry Association of Ontario estimates that New Year's Eve spending will fall to about $170 per person in Ontario this year, down from the previous year's average of $366.

According to the polling industry’s generally accepted standards, online surveys cannot be assigned a margin of error because they do not randomly sample the population.

In British Columbia, restaurants that have already stocked their food and liquor for New Year's Eve received unwelcome news Wednesday from the provincial government that they must stop selling alcohol at 8 p.m.

While both retailers and restaurants have had to move online during the COVID-19 pandemic, Joyal says consumers may not be aware that restaurants face different challenges than retailers when it comes to delivering goods bought online.

""We deal with perishables,"" Joyal says. ""We can't just call Canada Post and have people ship sandwiches beyond a certain radius. Traditional delivery apps are pretty cost prohibitive.""

Centralized delivery apps like Uber Eats, DoorDash and SkipTheDishes have become the go to databases of local fare due to in-restaurant dining restrictions. It can hard for any one restaurant to capture customers online when diners are looking to browse a long list rather than search for somewhere nearby, notes Sociavore Inc. co-founder Amina Gilani.

Gilani's Kitchener, Ont.-based company creates software for restaurants to do their own online orders and gift cards. She says Sociavore's customer base has tripled during the pandemic as restaurants build their own online ordering systems — sometimes as alternatives to the big apps.

""Delivery networks existed prior to Uber and prior to DoorDash. So when we are talking to restaurants throughout Canada and the U.S., many are utilizing those and keeping it really local,"" says Gilani.

""With restaurants you are kind of catering to a specific location or vicinity, as opposed to if you're a retailer and you can have a list and then ship the product wherever.""

Frier has been quietly building the Eating YYZ directory, adding 10 to 20 listings per day to his site. But even with over 100 restaurants listed, many categories on his website sit empty, as Frier says nearby chefs are struggling to keep up with newfound demand for online ordering options.

He says he has seen a growing number of people sharing social media posts saying ""Delete SkipTheDishes"" — though he says ordering through app-based deliveries is better for businesses than ordering nothing at all.

The apps have also faced a backlash from restaurateurs over the steep fees they charge and delivery problems that result in angry customers. On Dec. 19, Ontario began capping delivery fees to 15 per cent to help support local businesses. And on Dec. 6, SkiptheDishes agreed to pause its partnership with the Liquor Control Board of Ontario after critics said that local restaurants should get priority.

Raymond Costain says apps like Uber Eats help keep orders flowing for his restaurant Dope as Duck. With COVID-19, he can't have crowds inside, doesn't have much foot traffic nearby, and can't afford to hire his own delivery person.

But Costain also entered a listing on the Eating YYZ database last month, drawn to its content that interviews and connects local chefs.

""As opposed to being an individual trying to get the word out there, it's good to have a community where everyone can connect,"" says Costain.

"After 'Not Amazon' buoys local retail, restaurants unite in hope of New Year's boost",2020-12-31T18:55:38Z,"Toronto restaurateur Erik Joyal knew that his restaurants would need to do something different this New Year's Eve as the COVID-19 pandemic crashed everyone's party plans.

Seeing his fellow restaurateurs promoting prix fixe party boxes, meal kits, champagne flutes, and other creative New Year's celebrations, he decided to help organize an online show to boost visibility for small, independent business owners.

""I own three restaurants, a bar and a catering business. And so we thought to ourselves, what are we going to do?"" says Joyal. ""And then it just sort of morphed into, 'Well, maybe we should be thinking on a bigger level — with all the restaurants.""

As the COVID-19 pandemic limits New Year's Eve festivities, restaurants are banding together online in hopes that a ""shop local"" mentality can save the once-lucrative holiday for eateries.

One online event, Save Hospitality's NYE 2021 Big Night In, has built a database of about two hundred restaurants across the country. The event website has at least one listing for local restaurants in every province and territory.

A $19.95 ticket to the event gets buyers into an 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. online stream of performances by Canadian musicians. Joyal says virtual attendees allocate $5 from each ticket to a participating restaurant of their choice, which do not have to pay to be listed on the event's website and can also get extra donations from ticket sales.

Before COVID-19, regional food and event blogs would publish lists of New Year's Eve events in their region, but there was never much of a national restaurant alliance around the holiday, says Joyal.

But since the pandemic began, several groups of former restaurant rivals have banded together for events like Canada Takeout Day. Some cities, like Vaughan, Ont., even have government-run directories for local diners.

This Month’s Highlight

You’re Cordially Invited

Reese Witherspoon and Will Ferrell star in this wedding-hijinks comedy as two warring wedding planners for their sister (Meredith Hagner) and daughter (Geraldine Viswanathan), respectively. The hook? They’re both booked at the same venue and wedding day. You might expect a rom-com but Witherspoon and Ferrell’s dynamic in the trailer is giving more Seth Rogen vs. Zac Efron in Neighbors, which makes sense when you realize You’re Cordially Invited is the also directed by that movie’s director Nicholas Stoller. Then again, Stoller also directed Bros, so this could go either way! (Streaming January 30.)

With the Super Bowl’s 92.8 million-strong viewership topping the overall list of most-watched telecasts, pro football absolutely dominates those rankings. Thursday Night Football in particular earned quite the Christmas treat ahead of its exclusive shift to streaming via Amazon’s Prime Video, with the December 25 contest between the Cleveland Browns and the Green Bay Packers securing the second-largest TNF audience ever. Not a bad way to bow out of linear airings, I must say.

While the Browns/Packers game didn’t formally take place on the titular night, it certainly made Christmas a lot more interesting for football fans. The Thursday Night Football telecast, which aired across both its most recent high-dollar home at Fox and NFL Network, drew a pretty massive crowd of 28.59 million viewers, and averaged a gobsmacking 18-49 demographic rating of 10.8, according to Sports Media Watch . A lot of people tuned in to watch former Jeopardy! guest host Aaron Rodgers break Brett Favre’s record as all-time touchdown leader within the Packers franchise.

For comparison: NCIS is TV’s most-watched scripted series, and it’s still only averaging around a 1.0 demo rating after delayed viewing stats are tallied.

As stated previously, the Christmas Day game marked the second-largest number of total viewers for any Thursday Night Football game throughout its 15-year history. And it was quite a vast improvement on last year’s game between the Minnesota Vikings and the New Orleans Saints, with the Browns and Packers’ audience marking a 42% increase over the 2020 contest’s 20.1 million viewers. The demo rating itself was up 22% over that game’s still mightily impressive 8.9 demo average.

Even when looking at the more recent past, the Thursday Night Football game also brought in the second-largest TV audience of the current NFL season. The only game watched by more people was another holiday treat, the Thanksgiving telecast between the Las Vegas Raiders and the Dallas Cowboys. That game drew 37.8 million people, which marked the biggest regular season game audience in nearly three decades.

It’ll be interesting to see if and how Thursday Night Football ratings are handled in the future, considering Amazon isn’t exactly forthcoming with its viewership stats, similar to just about every other streaming service out there (save for Netflix and its limited-scope statistics ). But that’ll be where the weekly NFL games will stream exclusively for the next 10 years, with 15 games set to stream on the platform during the 2022 season. I have to think if the numbers are anywhere near as high as they are for linear TV NFL games, Amazon will be slightly more willing to offer detailed ratings info.

Not that the NFL has anything to worry about. Of the 100 most-watched telecasts throughout most of 2021, NFL games counted for around 40 entries on the list, with the Christmas Day TNF game added in. Outside of the NFL, NCAA football and basketball games were also peppered across that list, as well as the World Series, the NBA Finals, and Summer Olympics coverage . It’s safe to say that fans’ love of TV sports isn’t going anywhere, even if Thursday Night Football is.

"Amazon spat: Future Retail misses due date for payment of ₹3,494.6 cr to banks",2021-12-31T18:30:00Z,"Kishore Biyani-led Future Retail has missed the last date for payment of ₹3,494.56 crore to banks and others lenders as its assets sale deal was hampered due to its ongoing legal dispute with e-commerce giant Amazon.

Future Retail said due to ongoing litigations with Amazon.com NV Investment Holdings LLC, the company was not able to complete the planned monetisation of the specified business on due date.

""As discussed with the banks or lenders, the company would be co-operating for completing the monetisation of the specified business in next 30 days as per directions of the banks to resolve the current situation,"" the company said in a stock exchange filing today.

""The company shall intimate the further development and updates in this connection as and when applicable,"" it said.

Future Retail had last year entered into a one-time restructuring (OTR) scheme for COVID-19 hit companies with a consortium of banks and lenders and was to discharge ""an aggregate amount of ₹3,494.56 crore"" on or before December 31, 2021.

Lenders of Future Retail had in April 2021 had approved to restructure the existing financial debt of the company under an RBI announced resolution framework for COVID-19 related stress.

The said restructure had covered FRL's working capital demand, loans, term loans, cash credit, short term loans, NCDs, purchase bill discounting limits, other working capital loans and unpaid interest, which became overdue.

There were 28 banks, which have lent money to the group's retailing firm and were part of the exercise.

In August 2020, Future group had announced a ₹24,713 crore deal for the sale of the retail and wholesale business, and the logistics and warehousing business to Reliance Retail Ventures Ltd, a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Ltd.

However, e-commerce major Amazon is contesting the deal through its 49 per cent stake in Future Coupons Pvt Ltd (FCPL), which is a shareholder in Future Retail.

What Amazon’s 2021 tells us about the state of e-commerce,2021-12-31T17:46:11Z,"Former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos’ trip into space, whether you were a fan of it or not, perfectly summed up his ex-company’s year. Buoyed by incredible e-commerce growth, the massive marketplace is strapped to a rocket and headed for the stratosphere, on pace once again to set record revenue figures.

Though that’s nothing new for Amazon, it’s undeniably impressive.

“In 2019, Amazon’s revenue was [almost] $300 billion. And then in 2020, basically, it grew to almost $400 billion,” said Yoni Mazor, co-founder and chief growth officer at Getida, a company that works with Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) sellers to provide auditing and reimbursement services. “So for a company at the scale of $300 billion to grow 25% in one year — it’s just ballistic.”

As the largest online marketplace in the world, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has quite a bit of sway when it comes to e-commerce, and that’s never been more true than in 2021, with U.S. retail e-commerce sales topping $450 billion — led, of course, by Amazon.

“Amazon is … it’s everything,” Mazor told Modern Shipper. “I mean, this is their marketplace, this is their house, this is their rules.”

So with 2022 knocking on the door, Modern Shipper is taking a look back at Amazon’s year and what it says about the state of e-commerce — as well as where it’s headed.

Volume

The biggest e-commerce story of 2021 has been, without a doubt, the massive volume of products changing hands through online channels. U.S. e-commerce sales have grown an estimated 16% since the start of this year, and total U.S. e-commerce sales are projected to top $1 trillion for the first time ever in 2022. Much of that value passed (and will pass) through Amazon’s hands.

“People and consumers were stuck at home. They can’t really go out — they’re in lockdowns. So Amazon and e-commerce were the superheroes that were able to fulfill their needs,” Mazor said.





But seeing Amazon’s grip on e-commerce tighten, other companies large and small have increasingly turned to digital channels. Take, for example, Walmart (NYSE: WMT); after exploding in 2020 during the first year of the pandemic, the company’s digital sales in Q3 2021 still managed to top Q3 2020 by 8%.

Watch: Inside story of an Amazon seller

But SMBs are getting in on the action too. According to a December Sendlane survey of SMBs, 92% of respondents said their e-commerce sales grew in 2021, with 21% reporting that sales grew by 40% or more. Another 91% said that their e-commerce profits grew this year, and similarly, 90% saw their site traffic increase by at least 10%.

But that growth hasn’t come without some hurdles. According to Mazor, Amazon has faced “tremendous challenges” maintaining inventory and supply — and if the largest online retailer in the world is having trouble keeping products stocked, you can bet that SMBs are struggling too.

The NRF ​​reported in June that 97% of its approximately 18,000 member companies, which range from large corporations to mom-and-pop shops, experienced inventory shortages as they tried to keep up with the huge influx of digital sales. And seven in 10 retailers said that products are being delayed two to three weeks longer than normal.

So while e-commerce volume has increased across the board for retailers of all sizes, it’s also causing headaches when it comes to stocking inventory, whether you’re a massive company like Amazon or an independent seller.

Fulfillment

A clear leader in the e-commerce space, Amazon, with its nationwide network of thousands of warehouses, is also a bellwether when it comes to fulfillment.

Sellers on Amazon typically have two fulfillment options: either they can run their own warehouses and fulfill orders as they come in or they can ship inventory to Amazon and let FBA handle fulfillment and distribution. But when demand rose during the pandemic, FBA began to limit what third-party sellers could ship to Amazon.

For a few weeks, shipments were limited to products in PPE categories, like masks, but despite the temporary limitations, Amazon continued to maintain some restrictions even after opening FBA back up. For example, sellers that wanted to sell new products using FBA could only ship a limited quantity, which helped Amazon keep its marketplace stocked with products that were already in demand and in turn drove its growth in 2021.





Amazon’s sway over its sellers represents a larger e-commerce trend — larger companies’ domination of fulfillment. Mazor points to Walmart Fulfillment Services, Walmart’s answer to FBA, as the biggest indicator that other large companies want to get into fulfillment.

“That’s basically a copy/paste of what Amazon has done with FBA,” he said.

But it’s no small task. Amazon has hired hundreds of thousands of workers for its fulfillment centers and has been building those facilities for years in a bid to create a nationwide network of warehouses to be opened up to third-party sellers. Now it has more than 2 million U.S. sellers and 6 million worldwide, but only the largest retailers are able to handle that kind of volume.

“It’s a lot of work. It’s real estate, it’s labor, it’s technology, it’s manpower, it’s know-how, it’s liabilities if you take other people’s inventory,” Mazor emphasized, pointing out that marketplaces as large as eBay and Groupon faced similar problems. “The only exception to that is Walmart. … But compared to where Amazon is today, it’s not even a drop in the bucket. It’s like a drop in the ocean.”

However, as brands become more and more reliant on fulfillment capabilities, there could be more companies entering the playing field. For example, according to Mazor, Macy’s is planning on opening its own marketplace for third-party sellers leveraging microdistribution centers in its retail locations across the country.

“If that goes well, it’ll be interesting to see if they’re going to be pushed to adapt the model of opening up their fulfillment centers,” Mazor said. “They have a good spread around the country with all these regional and local malls.”

Sourcing

For as huge as Amazon is, the marketplace struggled with sourcing its products in 2021, a trend that’s trickled down into the entire e-commerce space. As has been the case for many U.S. retailers, the main sourcing pain points for Amazon are in China and Southeast Asia, where supply chain disruptions have thrown a wrench in its ability to get a steady supply. That’s hurting smaller sellers on the platform.

“The whole model of on-time supply on a global level worked great until the pandemic hit. And now it’s not so certain anymore,” Mazor explained. “The third-party sellers, many of whom source from Asia, are struggling hard. They were very nervous. The cost to source increased tremendously, and they were not able to get as much supply as they wanted to. It’s just a huge challenge all across Amazon.”

Of course, it isn’t just Amazon that faced this issue. Retailers selling everything from shoes to laptops have had a difficult time stocking their shelves, so much so that for the first time in history, Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales were lower than the year before.

“There wasn’t as much supply as there would have been if it wasn’t for all these challenges and consumers were able to shop more,” Mazor said. “In other words, many retailers got stocked out. They were able to sell maybe 10,000 units, but they only had 5,000 units.”

With retailers struggling to bring in products from overseas, Mazor thinks that they could instead begin turning toward home and manufacturing items domestically.

“If not domestic, then regional,” he said. “I know for a fact that a lot of [third-party sellers] are pushing towards sourcing products domestically here in the U.S. or Mexico or Central America. They’re talking to factories there. They are basically giving them the know-how to customize and create the product that they need and sourcing from there.”

Mazor thinks large companies will follow suit, moving at least some of their sourcing operations to the U.S. He compared the model to the U.S.’ oil supply chain, which is mostly situated abroad but has some domestic touch points to hedge against any supply chain disruptions. And while sourcing domestically is typically more expensive at face value, Mazor believes it’s more cost-effective in the long term because it can help retailers avoid disasters like the Suez Canal blockage in the spring.

“You have to be able to create a global supply chain that is less reliant on geography, meaning you have to be able to create a reliable infrastructure close by, at some degree, as a backup. You might still have China and Asia source the bulk of it, but you’re always going to invest in other infrastructures,” he explained.

The impact of China

As e-commerce becomes increasingly global, it’s no surprise that sellers from the largest country in the world are dominating the largest online marketplace in the world.

“Amazon has in the past decade really encouraged Chinese factories to learn how the platform works and given them direct access to the consumers, which is a big revelation for the factories,” Mazor told Modern Shipper. “So they have the muscle and capacity to provide an almost endless supply of a variety of goods, all the time, with ultra-competitive prices.”

That’s great for buyers because it translates to lower prices. But Amazon third-party sellers in the U.S. and elsewhere are being cut out of the loop by Chinese factories that beat them on capacity and price. They’re even losing out when it comes to product exposure.

“You’re not gonna see Nike gloves or socks necessarily coming up in the top of the search results organically on Amazon because it’s been dominated by all these factories who have lots of reviews on their listings,” Mazor explained. “And they just cracked the code.”

The gains of Chinese sellers on Amazon mirror the larger trend of China catching up to the U.S. when it comes to e-commerce sales. It’s been reported that this year, China will become the first country in the world at any point in history to have e-commerce sales comprise more than half of its total sales.

And in February, the International Trade Association reported that more than half of the world’s e-commerce transactions took place in China in 2020. It also estimated that the Chinese e-commerce market in 2021 will be larger than those of the U.S., U.K., Japan, Germany and France — combined.

Just as third-party Chinese sellers are dominating Amazon, Chinese companies are putting the global e-commerce market in a stranglehold. It’s just another parallel between Amazon and the broader e-commerce market, and we should continue to use the massive marketplace as an indicator going forward.

“Amazon is, when it comes to e-commerce, definitely the barometer of where things are at right now,” said Mazor, “and where they should be going.”

The Rings of Power

Lord of the Rings fans have been waiting years for new content from J.R.R.Tolkien's iconic fantasy universe, and The Rings of Power delivers. This epic drama is set thousands of years before the events of The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings, and uses lore from the novels to set up a rice and detailed prelude to those beloved films.

The series follows an ensemble cast of characters, some new and some familiar, as Middle-Earth faces the re-emergence of evil, the first since the fall of Morgoth. It details the creation of iconic Lord of the Rings elements like the rings of power, Mordor and the origin stories of Gandalf and Sauron.

The first season is an incredible watch, with stunning scenery, costuming, and choreographed battle scenes, and leaves viewers highly anticipating season two, which is already in production and began filming in October 2022.

There are eight episodes, all around 75 minutes in length, so each is like a little film in its own right.

Chloe

This Amazon original series is one of the best psychological dramas of the year.

It follows Becky, who is jaded with her lot in life and somewhat obsessively follows the activities of her former, now estranged childhood best friend Chloe and Chloe's glamorous new set of friends and husband via social media.

After Chloe's mysterious death, Becky wakes up with a missed call on her phone from Chloe after not speaking for years. Desperate for answers, Becky takes on a new identity to infiltrate the lives of Chloe's ex husband and friend group using the insider knowledge she gleaned from years of social media surveillance.

A truly brilliant and modern take on the outsider looking in trope, and with some commitment, you could binge watch all six episodes in an evening.

Spencer

If you missed this in the cinema, now is the time to catch up. There has been much interest in the British royal family lately, with the passing of Queen Elizabeth, the continued popularity of The Crown and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's tell-all docu-series.

Spencer is a historical psychological drama about the life of Princess Diana, focusing on some of the more difficult aspects of her role within the royal family and marriage. Spencer is not based on the true story of Princess Diana directly, but was rather inspired by her life.

Diana is played by Kristen Stewart, who has been widely praised for her portrayal.

Disney Plus

Pose

Pose is a heart-wrenching drama series which focuses on various characters involved in the ballroom culture of New York City in the 1980s and 1990s. The Ballroom Scene is an African-American and Latino underground LGBTQ+ subculture that originated in the Big Apple, and was a refuge for many queer and transgender individuals from the bigotry they faced in general society.

The series focuses on the struggles and the triumphs of this cast of characters as they fight to make space for themselves in a world that doe snot accept them on both racist and homophobic grounds, and documents the relationships within the community.

Painful but beautiful, this series will make you laugh, cry, ache at the injustices portrayed and marvel at the talents of the actors involved.

There are two seasons of eight and ten episodes respectively to get stuck into.

The Banshees of Inisherin

Another one to get into if you missed it in the cinema recently, The Banshees of Inisherin is set a remote island off the coast of Ireland.

Pádraic is devastated when his buddy Colm suddenly puts an end to their lifelong friendship, and he sets about first trying to rectify the friendship before things take a dark turn.

Set and filmed in Ireland, using Ireland's beautiful scenery and incredible acting talent, it's absolutely one to watch this weekend. It features Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon, Pat Shortt, Barry Keoghan and David Pearse among others.

The Dropout

A tale of ambition and fame gone terribly wrong, this series is based on the infamous story of Elizabeth Holmes, who fashioned herself after great tech minds such as Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg in her pursuit of being successful with her invention of tech-pharma product Theranos.

She raised $945 million for Theranos, promising investors and customer alike that the start-up would revolutionise health care with tests that required just a few drops of blood, but was found guilty in January 2022 of three counts of wire fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud by misleading investors, sentenced to 11 years in prison.

Amanda Seyfried has been praised for her portrayal of Elizabeth, and the series as a whole has been nominated for multiple awards as a biting depiction of the hustler mindset and pursuit of capitalistic gain.

Honourable mentions: Three Billboards Outside Ebbing Missouri, Death on The Nile, Murder on The Orient Express, Desperate Housewives, The Grand Budapest Hotel, Pam & Tommy, Moulin Rouge, Shang-Chi: Legend of the Ten Rings, The Rescue.

Mamma Mia!

This one should be self-explanatory.

While it is likely you have already seen it, a comforting rewatch is sometimes just what we need on a night like New Years.

Pop some prosecco or tuck into some tea and a takeaway as the absolute bops of ABBA carry the tale of Mamma Mia to fruition.

The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City

If you love reality TV and have already sunk your teeth into the big three Real Housewives franchises - Beverley Hills, New York and New Jersey - then The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City might be for you.

It has all the usual trappings of a great Housewives franchise: big money, decadent homes and b*tchy drama - however, there is another element to RHOSLC that we don't see focused on elsewhere: religion.

The women are from diverse religious backgrounds, but many of the storylines revolve around Mormonism, leaving Mormonism and evangelical Christian faith. It adds an insight into a culture that is not often portrayed, and gives and extra layer of interest to the series.

The Real Housewives: Ultimate Girls Trip

If you are already very familiar with the Real Housewives universe, then Ultimate Girls Trip is for you. It's like the Drag Race All-Stars version of RH, and features some of the most memorable cast members that have since left the show or are still on it.

There are two seasons, and the first season was filmed at the Triton Luxury Villa in Turks and Caicos Islands and features Cynthia Bailey, Luann de Lesseps, Teresa Giudice, Melissa Gorga, Kenya Moore, Kyle Richards, and Ramona Singer.

The second season was filmed in September 2021 at Dorinda Medley's Blue Stone Manor located in Great Barrington, Massachusetts and features former Housewives stars who are no longer cast-members on their original series. The cast consists of Taylor Armstrong, Brandi Glanville, Gunvalson, Tamra Judge, Eva Marcille, Medley, Phaedra Parks and Jill Zarin.

It is a great refresher of old iconic RH drama, and reminds us why some of the former cast members are so beloved.

Prince Harry's tell-all £28 memoir 'Spare' to be sold for as little as £8 in Tesco,2022-12-31T20:00:00Z,"Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions and adverts from us and our partners. You can check out at any time. More info

Prince Harry’s bombshell book Spare is heading for the bargain bin - before it has even been released.

Industry experts believe the book officially priced £28 will go on sale in Tesco for as little as £8 a copy.

Waterstones and Amazon have already slashed the price in half to £14.

Its title appears to be a nod to Harry’s place in the line of succession.

A source said: “It’s more a case of spare change than Spare. In fact it wouldn’t be a huge shock if Harry’s book ends up even cheaper at a store like The Works.”

Some small bookshops are not bothering to stock the Duke of Sussex’s memoirs Spare - fearing no one will buy it at its £28 full price.

Spare, which the 38-year-old Duke describes as “raw, unflinchingly honest” and “full of revelation”, will be released on January 10.

Tesco, slogan Every Little Helps, is preparing to sell the 416-page hardback for a rock bottom price to Clubcard holders - according to experts.

Adam Barclay, of Argonaut Books in Edinburgh, said: “The large Tesco around the corner from us is almost certainly going to be selling it for £12/£8 with a Clubcard.”

He said: “Even with favourable margins, £28 is too high a price for us to be able to compete with Amazon and other big chains such as Waterstones, and, more pressingly, supermarkets.”

Phil Davies, of Pigeon Books in Southsea, Hants, told trade magazine The Bookseller: “I don’t think I’ll be stocking it, and haven’t yet had any requests to order it.

“I’m assuming it’ll be another title that the likes of Smiths and Waterstones will be heavily discounting from the go, so it’s really not worth our while trying to compete.”

The US-based Duke is understood to be “contractually obliged” to use his fame to promote the book ahead of its release.

It was this month reported that he may publicise Spare in an lengthy sit-down interview with ITV news anchor Tom Bradby.

But he is unlikely to hold an open press conference, public question-and-answer session or conduct TV and radio interviews.

Publisher Transworld described Spare as “a landmark publication full of insight, revelation, self-examination and hard-won wisdom about the eternal power of love over grief.”

Its release comes after the Duke and wife Meghan, 41, criticised the Royal Family in their six part-Netflix series.

In July 2021 Meg’s highly-anticipated childrens book The Bench was spotted on sale at a discount at The Works, which bills itself as “Britain’s leading discount books store”.

Transworld was approached for comment, as was Tesco and Archewell, the Sussex’s foundation.

Waterstones said it needed to compete against heavy online discounting.",https://www.irishmirror.ie/showbiz/celebrity-news/prince-harrys-tell-28-memoir-28849481

Yes. You can add multiple products and discounts to your cart at the same time. Most Amazon coupons allow you to buy only a single unit of each product at the discounted rate, though.

Amazon is pretty strict in its policies, and if the discount isn't showing before you check out, the company won't refund the difference. Before putting in your payment method, you'll want to check your cart during this process to ensure that it shows the expected discount amount.

Yes. The coupons here have no bearing on Amazon's return policy. You'll still be able to return the item should it not meet your needs, but you'll be refunded only the amount you paid for it. If there are multiple coupons on your order it may look a bit trickier, since the discount amount will be different, but you'll be refunded the price of the item plus any applicable sales tax.

"For Lula and the World, the Tough Job of Saving the Amazon Begins",2022-12-31T16:00:07Z,"The incoming administration has signaled that the new president will repeal policies that expanded gold mining in the Amazon and obstructed the system for environmental fines, an important deterrent. It plans to bolster the federal agencies tasked with protecting the rainforest and to create a federal police unit to investigate the sophisticated criminal gangs behind the looting of the jungle.

It will also reactivate the Amazon Fund, a conservation program that has been central to curbing deforestation but was frozen in 2019. The fund has $600 million that can be used to finance the country’s main environmental protection agency, the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources, and other agencies.

But it is unclear whether these measures will have a real impact.

Officials charged with leading anti-deforestation campaigns in Mr. Lula’s first and second terms told me that it might take several years simply to lower deforestation rates to pre-Bolsonaro-era levels. That is mainly because the dynamics of environmental crime in the Amazon have changed in the past decade and the tactics used in the past by the federal agencies — satellite data and the deployment of federal agents — might provide limited results.

Deforestation is now being driven by criminal networks that conduct sophisticated schemes to hide the illegal origins of commodities like beef, gold and timber from the Amazon and sell them on international markets. A 2022 study by the Igarapé Institute, a Brazilian think tank, found that though the “cluster of converging crimes” varies in each Amazonian region, it often involves violence, corruption, financial crimes and fraud.

Some multinational companies have agreed to shun soy and beef produced in deforested areas, and the European Union is preparing to adopt a regulation that will force companies to prove that their goods have not led to deforestation and forest degradation. But China — a top buyer of Brazilian soy, beef and leather — has remained silent. To save the jungle, Mr. Lula must persuade Beijing to set guidelines to ensure the traceability of products from soy and cattle suppliers in Brazil.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/31/opinion/brazil-elections-amazon-rainforest.html

“I Have Decided to Seek Legal Action Against Jeff Bezos”: Amazon Prime’s “Attempted Murder” Live on National TV Prompts NFL Player to Amuse Twitter With Odd Remarks,2022-12-31T15:37:56Z,"The Tennessee Titans lost their sixth-straight game when the Dallas Cowboys outplayed them in Week 17. And a Titans star is threatening Amazon owner Jeff Bezos with legal action in the aftermath. The NFL star has accused Amazon Prime of “attempted murder” on national television. Jokingly, of course.

The Titans lost star tackle Taylor Lewan to a season-ending injury back in week two this season. But an action of Amazon Prime has prompted Lewan to amuse Twitter with an odd remark.

NFL star threatens Jeff Bezos

The Titans are running low on gas this season. The squad has a number of injured players and that has affected them adversely in games. Amazon Prime highlighted the issue with a hilarious graphic on Thursday Night Football game against the Cowboys this week. But tackle Taylor Lewan is not happy with it. He jokingly threatened Amazon owner Jeff Bezos with legal action.

“After last nights attempted murder of myself and some of the other titan players during the Thursday night broadcast on Amazon prime I have decided to seek legal action against Jeff Bezos,” Lewan tweeted with the same wheelchair photo used in the graphic.

The same photo featured on the endzone before the Arizona Bowl game. And Lewan did not fail to react to it too.

Amazon Prime used his photo on a wheelchair in a graphic to show how banged up the Titans squad is at the moment. The graphic was hilarious, but Lewan’s response made it even more fun. Lewan’s career in the NFL has been plagued with injuries throughout and he has missed several games due to it.

An injury-plagued career

Taylor Lewan started his NFL career back in 2014 as a first-round draft pick for the Titans. He has shown his class on the field on numerous occasions. But injuries have never let him reach his full potential.

His first five seasons with the Titans yielded maximum results for the star. Lewan featured in the Pro Bowl thrice in that period. But since the 2019 season, he has missed a major chunk of time off the field. He missed five games that year due to a failed drug test. In 2020, he did not feature after week six due to a torn ACL. Last season too, he missed as many as four games due to injuries.

These combined features ensure comprehensive air purification, making your home environment healthier and more comfortable.

What are the key features to consider when choosing an air purifier in India? Look for HEPA filters for efficient allergen removal, CADR (Clean Air Delivery Rate) for room size compatibility, and noise levels suitable for your environment.

How can I ensure the longevity and efficiency of my air purifier in Indian conditions? Regularly clean and replace filters as recommended by the manufacturer. Place the purifier in an area with good airflow and avoid excessive humidity to maintain optimal performance.

What are the top considerations for air purifiers in Indian cities with high pollution levels? Opt for air purifiers with high CADR ratings and effective filtration systems capable of handling PM2.5 particles prevalent in urban environments. Look for models with air quality sensors for real-time monitoring and automatic adjustments.

Which air purifier brand is the best? Determining the best air purifier brand depends on your specific needs, room size, and budget. However, some brands are widely recognized for their quality and performance. Honeywell offers durable and effective purifiers with user-friendly features. Coway is praised for powerful filtration and eco-friendly designs. Eureka Forbes is renowned for high-performance, energy-efficient purifiers with quiet operation. Each brand has its strengths, so choose based on the type of pollutants, room size, and desired features.

Factors to consider before buying an air purifier for home Room size and coverage: Ensure the air purifier is suitable for the room size. Check the Clean Air Delivery Rate to know how efficiently it can purify the air in the specified area.

Filtration technology: Opt for a purifier with a HEPA filter to capture small particles like pollen, dust, and pet dander. Additional filters like activated carbon can help remove odours and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

Noise level: Consider the noise level, especially if you plan to use it in a bedroom or living room. Look for models with a low decibel rating or a quiet mode for undisturbed sleep and daily activities.

Maintenance and filter replacement: Check the frequency and cost of filter replacements. Some models have indicators that notify you when it's time to change filters.

Energy efficiency and additional features: Choose energy-efficient models to save on electricity bills. Additional features like air quality sensors, smart connectivity, and multiple fan speeds can enhance convenience and performance.

Coroner calls on Google and Amazon to act after British woman’s suicide,2023-12-31T16:55:08Z,"Google and Amazon must act after a British woman made a suicide pact with two people she met online and bought the poison that killed her on the internet, a coroner has said.

Chloe Macdermott, 43, died on 23 May 2021 after buying a lethal substance from the US on Amazon. She had been struggling with her mental health for several years before she began researching ways to end her life on an online forum, an inquest at inner west London coroner’s court was told this month.

Two days before her death, she “formed an association” with two people with whom she planned suicide. A day later, she contacted them while her husband was away and “an agreement was made to act that night”. She ingested the substance at about midnight and died from its effects the next morning.

The coroner Paul Rogers recorded a conclusion of suicide and issued a prevention of future deaths report to Google and Amazon, saying he believes they have the power to prevent another similar tragedy.

The report has also been sent to the home, health and culture secretaries and the national lead for suicide prevention at the National Police Chiefs’ Council.

Rogers said it was a matter of concern that the forum that Macdermott used and others like it “encourage suicide, assist it by provision of information about suicide methods, counsel suicide by providing information about it and thereby potentially facilitate the commission of a criminal offence in the United Kingdom”.

He said: “[The forum, whose name was redacted] permits material to be exchanged and viewed within its open chatrooms whereby suicide is encouraged, assisted, counselled and procured through the provision and exchange of information and methods.

“No age or other restrictions are in place to prevent access to children, vulnerable teenagers and vulnerable adults. No prominent signposting is in place to organisations from whom help is available to prevent suicide. Posts are made by users containing details of methods of suicide without any effective administration to remove such harmful content.”

The availability of the poison online and the ability of Britons to have it delivered from the US “without effective border and/or custom controls” was also a matter of concern, Rogers said.

All organisations that the coroner has written to must respond within 56 days. They must outline the action they intend to take to prevent future deaths and a timetable for doing so. If no action is proposed, they must explain why.",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2023/dec/31/coroner-calls-on-google-and-amazon-to-act-after-british-womans-suicide
"OnePlus 10 Pro now available at Rs 22000, but rethink before buying | Reason",2023-12-31T11:13:34Z,"OnePlus 10 Pro now available at Rs 22000, but rethink before buying | Reason Amazon is reportedly offering a significant discount on the OnePlus 10 Pro handset, but all the consumers will have to consider these three things, before making a purchase.

Amazon is reportedly offering a lot of discounts on a host of smartphones, but that does not mean you should buy all of them. The e-commerce giant is also selling the OnePlus 10 Pro at a lower rate, but you might want to skip it. The OnePlus 10 Pro is currently being offered at a discounted price of Rs 22,000 on Amazon. While this price slash might appear as an irresistible steal, one must consider several aspects before plunging into the purchase. Here are three reasons why a customer must look twice before buying the tempting device.

About OnePlus 10 Pro

The handset was released in India almost two years ago, (in March 2022). As the technology progresses rapidly, two-year-old smartphones might lack the latest features and advancements which was found in more recent releases.

The handset comes with 8GB RAM and 128GB storage, which provides higher configurations, like 16GB RAM and internal storage of up to 1 TB. Powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chipset.

However, there are some concerns related to the future of support and usability of the OnePlus 10 Pro.

Software Support: With the OnePlus 10 Pro nearing its existence for two years, the likelihood of receiving ongoing software updates might decrease as compared to the smartphones which were released in 2023. This could limit access to the new features and security updates.

Green Line Issue: There were several reports and complaints from the users of the OnePlus 10 Pro, about a recurring green line issue on their screens which raised significant concerns.

By considering these factors, potential buyers expect to avoid the risks and limitations which are associated with purchasing the OnePlus 10 Pro against the advantages offered by more current smartphone models available in the market.

"Will relaxations for Flipkart, Amazon make it to final e-commerce policy?",2023-12-30T18:30:00Z,"The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) is examining the national e-commerce policy to understand its potential impact on domestic retailers and small players, two people aware of the matter said. “The policy is in its final stage and will be released soon after the approval by the PMO,"" said one of the people, adding the much-awaited policy will protect the interests of both consumers and industry.

The development is significant given the draft policy framed by the Union commerce ministry has recommended relaxations for companies that operate on e-marketplace business models such as Amazon, Flipkart and others.

The evaluation by the PMO follows a meeting on 2 August conducted by the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), which is formulating the national e-commerce policy, with all stakeholders including representatives of e-commerce firms and a domestic traders’ body.

The relaxations suggested in the policy include separate norms for marketplace and inventory models of e-commerce on appointment of nodal grievance officers, no mandatory registration on the Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) for e-commerce majors, no provision for setting up of an independent regulator for online retail platforms; etc.

Queries sent to the PMO, ministries of commerce and consumer affairs, secretaries of DPIIT and consumer affairs, and Amazon and Flipkart remained unanswered till press time.

An e-commerce industry leader who spoke on condition of anonymity expressed concern that these relaxations may not make it to the final policy given that e-commerce is highly contentious, and relaxations are opposed by conventional retailers.

“The current e-commerce scenario has an uneven playing field, giving many disadvantages to small businesses,"" said Praveen Khandelwal, general secretary of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT). “Now, it’s high time that both the e-commerce policy and its rules should be notified immediately as it has been assured.""

The domestic traders’ body demands foolproof e-commerce rules against predatory pricing, deep discounting and loss funding. “Any entity having an economic interest should not be allowed to sell products on its own e-commerce platforms,"" Khandelwal added, referring to the practice of marketplace platforms in India selling their own products, called white labels.

The proposed policy has no provision for setting up of an independent regulator for online retail platforms, and e-commerce firms will have to comply with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act for data-related issues as the proposed policy will not cover that area, the first official said. A detailed presentation in this regard was given to the PMO, the official cited earlier said.

The draft policy calls for mandating e-commerce players to procure agricultural products directly from farmer producer organizations and cooperatives, the officials mentioned above said. It also has watertight norms for e-tail giants on predatory pricing, and mandatory registration of all type of e-business portals with DPIIT.

“A certificate issued by DPIIT to registered e-commerce portals will be mandatory for validation of online portals’ existence. It will save consumers from being cheated by fake or unregulated portals,"" the second official cited above said.

The draft policy has also pitched for relaxing mandatory registration on ONDC for e-commerce majors, as reported by Mint on 22 November. Instead, it is likely to propose voluntary registration.

The policy also talks about separate norms for marketplace and inventory models of e-commerce on appointment of nodal grievance officers.

The marketplace model refers to platforms that connect thousands of sellers with potential buyers, but do not store the products or manage their supply. Amazon and Flipkart, among others, operate on this model.

In the inventory or warehousing-based model of e-commerce, platforms store inventory from brands, merchants and sellers, manage the inventory, and sell the products directly to consumers.",https://www.livemint.com/politics/policy/will-relaxations-for-flipkart-amazon-make-it-to-final-e-commerce-policy-11704044268432.html
2 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Up 159% and 217% in 2023 to Buy in 2024,2023-12-30T18:15:00Z,"Artificial intelligence (AI) swept investors into a frenzy in 2023. It all started with Microsoft's $10 billion bet in January on generative AI start-up OpenAI, which develops the famous ChatGPT online chatbot. Then in September Amazon invested $4 billion in OpenAI rival Anthropic.

But those trillion-dollar tech giants weren't the only ones scooping up AI assets. Everyday investors identified several small-cap AI stocks with explosive potential throughout the year, including C3.ai (NYSE: AI) and Upstart Holdings (NASDAQ: UPST). Those stocks recorded gains of 159% and 217%, respectively in 2023, and 2024 could bring more upside.

Here's why it isn't too late to buy into those opportunities in the new year.

1. C3.ai's revenue growth is set to accelerate

Founded in 2009, C3.ai was one of the first companies ever to provide AI products and services to businesses. Today it has developed over 40 ready-made and customizable applications to bring AI to at least 10 different industries, accelerating its customers' adoption of the technology.

For example, the C3.ai Demand Forecasting platform can help businesses improve the accuracy of their forward sales projections by up to 15%. That allows them to maintain more appropriate inventory levels and pricing, which leads to happier customers.

Similarly, C3.ai Reliability is the ultimate predictive maintenance tool, and can slash unplanned equipment downtime in half by detecting unusual activity before it leads to catastrophe. It's used by some of the world's largest organizations, including Shell and the U.S. Air Force.

C3.ai's revenue growth slowed to a crawl over the last 18 months. It was the expected temporary consequence of a major shift away from subscription-based deals and toward consumption-based deals. Subscriptions require lengthy negotiations between C3.ai and the customer, which increases acquisition costs and slows the onboarding process. By moving to a consumption model, customers can come and go as they please and simply pay for what they use.

C3.ai is still transitioning its existing customers over to the new model, but progress is now ramping up quickly. In the recent fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Oct. 31), the company's revenue came in at $73.2 million, which represented a 17% year-over-year increase. That was the fastest growth rate in over a year, and C3.ai's projections suggest it will continue to accelerate in the coming quarters.

C3.ai stock gained 159% in 2023, but it remains 83% below its all-time high, which was set during the tech frenzy at the end of 2020. Investors got a little carried away with the company's valuation back then, but that created an opportunity for new buyers to scoop up C3.ai stock at a discount now ahead of a material projected upswing in its business.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-unstoppable-artificial-intelligence-ai-181500685.html

You’re going to have to be quick in securing your stock though, as we’re not sure how much time is remaining before this offer expires.

Why you should buy the Blue Yeti microphone

There have been variations to the popular microphone, such as the Blue Yeti X that we’ve included in our roundup of the best microphones for streaming as our top choice for beginners, but the original Blue Yeti remains an excellent option for anybody who wants to produce professional-quality audio. It features a custom three-capsule array and four pickup patterns — flexible cardioid, omni, bidirectional, and stereo — so you’ll be able to record voices, music, and other types of sound in ways that would usually require more than one microphone.

The Blue Yeti comes with onboard audio controls that will let you select the pickup pattern, adjust your headphones’ volume, and instantly mute the microphone. It’s easy to set up with any computer, and you’ll also have access to the Blue VO!CE software that will let you add enhanced affects, apply advanced modulation, and access HD audio samples to make your recordings and streams even more interesting to your listeners.

If you need a microphone for any reason, you simply can’t go wrong with one of the top choices in the market: the Blue Yeti. It’s an even more attractive purchase right now because it’s available from Best Buy for only $100, for savings of $30 on its sticker price of $130.

Tech titans trying to engage Trump through Mar-a-Lago trips,2024-12-31T18:38:42Z,"The most powerful leaders in the tech industry are trying out a new playbook to engage Donald Trump, who has been historically opposed to their dominance: in-person dining.

A steady stream of some of the biggest names in technology — Meta Platforms Inc.’s Mark Zuckerberg, Google co-founder Sergey Brin and Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos — have all made pilgrimages to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club in Florida to meet with the president-elect, a stark reversal from his 2016 victory, when many business leaders kept their distance, instead currying favor by hiring well-connected lobbyists.

“EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE MY FRIEND!!!,” Trump posted to Truth Social recently.

That remark echoes a comment he made during a press conference drawing a contrast with his first term when “everyone was fighting” to now, with corporate executives clamoring to dine with him on his Palm Beach resort’s patio.

Trump is the first Republican in the last 20 years to win the popular vote. He lost it in 2016 even as he won the Electoral College to secure the White House. Now, in addition to the entreaties to have a private audience with him, he’s also racking up a wave of executive or corporate commitments to finance his inauguration.

The president-elect has been openly hostile to some in the tech sector, sharing his gripes on Truth Social — the social media platform he started after he was kicked off many mainstream sites after the 2021 U.S. Capitol insurrection. Trump’s complaints have ranged from bias against conservative voices on Facebook to unfavorable Google search results.

Still, Trump also enjoys hobnobbing with wealthy, successful business leaders, many of whom are celebrities in their own right.

Motivating some of the executives to establish a rapport with Trump is the concern that their company, products or they personally could be the target of social media missives that the president-elect is known to fire off at any time, often without warning.

“I think the term is ‘panic.’ These guys were all anti-Trump, and they all know he has a great memory, an enormous amount of energy and is quite prepared to go after people who he thinks are a problem,” former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said in an interview.

At a recent dinner, Trump and Bezos were joined by Trump’s son Eric and his wife, Melania, along with Tesla Inc. and SpaceX Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk, a major campaign donor and the world’s richest person, according to a person familiar with the gathering.

“President Trump is surrounding himself with industry leaders like Elon Musk as he works to restore innovation, reduce regulation and celebrate free speech in his second term,” Trump spokesperson Brian Hughes said in a statement.

As threats of fresh rounds of tariffs loom, as well as a yearning in some Republican circles to crack down on tech giants, CEOs and founders see the value in proactively making their case to Trump and his top lieutenants.

Tech giants also rely on foreign workers, an issue that created a firestorm on social media recently. Trump last week said he agrees with Musk about the use of the H-1B visa, saying he backs the program for foreign tech workers that some of his supporters oppose. Trump’s remarks came after a series of social media posts from Musk who said he would go to “war” to defend the visa program.

Bezos was a target of Trump’s jabs during his first term. At a recent dinner, he found himself at the same table as Musk — one of the few people in the world wealthier than him — and whose Starlink satellite internet is one of the fiercest competitors to Amazon’s Project Kuiper. Amazon’s service has fallen behind schedule on development and the company is faced with the prospect of an incoming administration stacked with people closely aligned with SpaceX.

Zuckerberg visited Trump and several of his advisers at Mar-a-Lago in late November. The series of meetings, which took place over two days, included sessions with Susie Wiles, Trump’s incoming chief of staff; Stephen Miller, a top adviser; and Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s pick for secretary of state. The Meta chief executive gave Trump a demo of the company’s new Ray-Ban branded smartglasses, which have become a top product priority for the company as it pushes deeper into artificial intelligence and wearables.

Zuckerberg has made clear that he’s interested in advising Trump on tech policy moving forward, and Meta is arguably the company that stands to benefit the most from a possible ban of TikTok, which could come as soon as January. Meta has a rival video product, called Reels, that is already popular with young people and could see an influx of new users if TikTok is ultimately banned.

The Zuckerberg visit to Mar-a-Lago was a positive step for someone who has been a target of Trump’s ire over the years. The president-elect suggested on the campaign trail that Zuckerberg should be jailed for alleged election interference during the 2020 U.S. elections, and called Facebook the “Enemy of the People” back in March.

Brin and the CEO of Google parent company Alphabet Inc. Sundar Pichai also dined with Trump last month, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The overtures from the Google executives to the president-elect are a noteworthy departure from the search giant’s approach to the first Trump administration. After the 2016 election, Pichai and Brin, who are both immigrants, criticized Trump’s proposal to ban people from several Muslim-majority countries from traveling to or seeking refuge in the U.S. — with Brin even joining protesters at the San Francisco International Airport in January 2017. “I’m here because I’m a refugee,” Brin told reporters at the time.

The meeting with Trump comes as Google is set to tussle with the government on several critical fronts in the coming year, including antitrust issues and AI regulation. Trump has named several critics of Google to his administration, including Brendan Carr to head the Federal Communications Commission. He has accused Google of manipulating search results and allegedly censoring conservative viewpoints.

Trump has also criticized Google and said the company should be prosecuted for showing only “bad stories” about him during the 2024 campaign. An antitrust case alleging the tech giant’s dominance in search, which the Justice Department won earlier this year, began in the Trump administration. But in recent months, he has struck a more conciliatory tone, saying in an interview with Bloomberg News that he didn’t think the Justice Department should break up Google as part of the agency’s antitrust case against the company.

Pichai has reportedly spoken with Trump at least two other times in recent months, including after the November election when he congratulated the president-elect on his victory. And in October, Trump said Pichai told him: “You’re the No. 1 person on all of Google for stories.”",https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/12/31/tech-titans-trying-to-engage-trump-through-mar-a-lago-trips/
Amazon begins requiring workers in office five days per week; some are not happy,2024-12-31T16:52:01Z,"As Amazon prepared for its workers to be back in the office five days a week, Christian Carron decided to quit.

Carron thought virtual work was here to stay. In 2022, when Amazon was still allowing employees to work entirely from home, he moved into a van, hoping to live out his dream of a nomadic lifestyle.

He said he was more productive, even as he traveled the country, parking at ski resorts to get some runs in after work. He was energized by the flexibility, the changes of scenery and the access to nature.

In 2023, when Amazon reversed course and told employees they would have to return to the office three days a week, Carron disagreed with the decision but was willing to be flexible. That willingness faded over the following months as Amazon leadership kept changing expectations.

At first, the requirement was three days a week from any office. Then from a hub city. Then from a specific building.

Finally, in September, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy dropped the hammer: Starting Thursday, Amazon will require employees to be in the office five days a week, a return to pre-pandemic norms and a shift from the flexibility employees had become used to. While Amazon leaders and neighborhood restaurants and retailers are eager for the change, some employees are not.

Businesses hope to see a revitalization driven by lunch runs, happy hours and shopping. Amazon hopes to foster a collaborative office environment that will spur innovation.

Employees, on the other hand, are bracing for renewed commutes, noisy offices and less-productive workdays. Some have asked the company to reconsider. Others like Carron have quit, while others say they feel they are being laid off because they can’t relocate across the country.

“They’re trying to say it’s just a matter of will,” said one employee who would need to relocate from the East Coast, and who asked to remain anonymous to protect future job possibilities at Amazon. “It’s just a matter of you making the decision, just walk through the door. But if this process is starting from that perspective, it’s wrong.”

An Amazon spokesperson said the return will strengthen company culture and ensure teams can deliver the best results. Jassy told employees in September that in-person work will help teammates learn from one another and help the company be more effective.

“When we look back over the last five years, we continue to believe that the advantages of being together in the office are significant,” he wrote in a letter.

Six employees who spoke with The Seattle Times said that after months of shifting expectations, they have lost trust in leadership.

Carron resigned in December after five years at the company. He said he “absolutely” would have stayed at the company if not for the return to office.

Carron isn’t the only employee who lost trust in Amazon leadership, or decided to look for a new job.

A rumor accusing Amazon of using RTO as an attempt to increase attrition, allowing the company to decrease head count without layoffs, gained so much traction that Jassy addressed it in an all-hands meeting. He said the return to office was not a “backdoor layoff.”

“This was not a cost play for us,” Jassy said. “This is very much about our culture and strengthening our culture.”

Carron and another employee who listened to the meeting said Jassy’s remarks didn’t put them at ease.

“There hasn’t been clear direction throughout the entire process,” Carron said. “I can’t trust the messages that I hear.”

More than 500 employees from Amazon Web Services, the company’s cloud computing division, sent a letter in October to AWS CEO Matt Garman urging him to restore the flexibility of remote work. The letter came days after Garman told workers that “there are other companies around” if employees don’t want to return.

Two surveys suggest there is a vocal contingent of employees who disagree with the mandate. Blind, a social media platform for tech workers to anonymously share complaints, conducted a September survey of 2,500 Amazon workers and found most were dissatisfied by the return to office decision.

The Strategic Organizing Center, a coalition of labor unions that has accused Amazon of prioritizing profits over worker well-being, conducted its own survey of 1,000 corporate workers in November. Nearly half said they had already applied to new jobs because of the return-to-office mandate.

Amazon has more than 350,000 corporate employees globally, mostly in the U.S. In Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond, Washington, which Amazon considers its primary headquarters, Amazon has roughly 65,000 corporate workers.

Last year, as Amazon’s three-day requirement took effect, employees loudly disagreed and hundreds participated in a walkout in protest. This year, the cries of disapproval have been quieter but opponents say the criticisms are just as widespread.

CJ Felli, an AWS employee based in Seattle, doesn’t expect the mandate will change his daily routine — he already goes to the office most days. But it will change his productivity.

Before the pandemic, Felli said, Amazon managers often allowed employees to stay home if they needed a distraction-free day to work on a coding project. Amazon leaders said that would be still allowed in this new era, but some employees are skeptical they’ll be able to easily get approval to skirt the new rules.

Now, Felli is worried about noise near his desk and other obstacles to get set up in the morning. Traffic around bike stalls and in parking garages will increase. Elevators and conference rooms will fill.

“If it was hard to focus before, it’s going to be even worse,” Felli said.

His plan? Come in early, set a stopwatch for four hours and then finish the rest of the workday from home.

Other employees who spoke with The Seattle Times said days in the office so far have been full of distractions.

Carron said he spent 90% of his day in a small booth talking with vendors across the country. Meetings with his team, even those who were in the same building, still took place virtually because no one had the time to find one another in the maze of office space, he said.

Stephanie Ramos, a former Amazon employee based in Nashville, Tennessee, who joined the company in 2017, said she didn’t experience Amazon’s idyllic vision of water cooler conversation after the three-day return last year.

She enjoyed the free coffee and access to an art-making space, where she once attended a lunchtime improv session. But she sat next to different people every day and had to keep her personal belongings in a locker.

“The idea that you’re going to have these serendipitous encounters with folks in the office that really help you understand your work and help you understand Amazon, I don’t see that happening,” Ramos said. “People didn’t talk to each other.”

As part of the new return to office mandate, Amazon also plans to bring back assigned desks.

Ramos quit Amazon in October, feeling the company had changed too much from when she was first hired. After six years on the job, Ramos, who had been working as a program manager, was laid off in 2023, part of sweeping job cuts. She returned for a new role in a new city in 2024 and found the “magic” was gone.

As an example, she compared her two orientations. In 2017, she had a two-week in-person orientation, including a visit to an Amazon warehouse. In 2024, she had a three-day virtual orientation with hundreds of other people.

“This is not the Amazon I remember,” she said in December. “It feels like it’s sinking into bureaucracy.”

Amazon’s CEO seems to agree, telling employees in the September note announcing return to office that the company’s structure and work processes had room to improve.

Amazon likes to think of itself as “the world’s largest startup,” Jassy said, but years of explosive growth had led to layers of bureaucracy.

“Having the right culture at Amazon is something I don’t take for granted,” Jassy said.

Ramos, Felli and Carron each said they saw the need for change at Amazon but didn’t think RTO was going to bring back the Amazon they had once joined.

“People are going through the motions, but they don’t really understand the purpose of these mechanisms that Amazon has created,” Ramos said. “I don’t think the solution is going to address the problem.”

Another employee, who asked to remain anonymous to protect their job, is worried RTO will be a “detriment” to the company because it will lose talent and institutional knowledge as people leave — some voluntarily and some without a choice if they can’t relocate.

That employee and another from Amazon Games, a video game subsidiary, said they were given an ultimatum two weeks before the new policy kicked in: Relocate or resign.

Up until that meeting, it hadn’t been clear if Amazon Games would enforce the mandate, the workers said. Suddenly, if they didn’t comply, Amazon would “consider this as a voluntary resignation,” one employee’s manager wrote in an email shared with The Seattle Times.

Both employees said relocation isn’t an option for them. They have children and homes and were under the impression they had been hired into a remote role. Now, they’re preparing for what may be their last day, facing what feels more like a layoff than a resignation.",https://www.chicagotribune.com/2024/12/31/amazon-begins-requiring-workers-in-office-five-days-per-week-some-are-not-happy/

Amazon reduces ice bath that's 'perfect for post-gym cooldowns' by 36%,2024-12-31T15:26:42Z,"Amazon has reduced an ice bath that's 'perfect for post-gym cooldowns' by £40. The Polar Recovery Tub was a best-seller on the site and one fan said it had 'transformed their back garden into a personal retreat' and helped to soothe sore muscles.

Now costing £69.99, down from £109.99, the Polar Recovery Tub was said to help 'reduce inflammation' through cold water therapy and 'speed up the recovery process'. Large enough to sit in cross-legged, the ice bath was said to be suitable for people up to 6’7"".

The Polar Recovery Tub comes with a free protective cover to stop bugs, leaves and other debris falling in, and had been 'built to withstand even the harshest winter elements', according to the product description.

The ice bath was also said to be 'super easy' to clean and required 'minimal' maintenance, although it was recommended the water was changed every 10 days. Geo left a five star review for the Polar Recovery Tub and said: ""Imagine transforming your back garden into a personal retreat where every dip revitalises and refreshes you.""

He continued: ""Setting up the tub was straightforward, with clear instructions and all the necessary parts included. My initial concern about the size disappeared as I, standing at 5’10” and weighing 99kg, found it spacious and comfortable. Maintaining the temperature can be challenging during the warmer months, but the thermal lid does an excellent job of keeping the water cool for longer. I've incorporated this into my post-gym routine, and it’s been fantastic for muscle recovery.""

The ice bath is spacious and feels extremely sturdy and I can comfortably climb in and easily sit cross legged in there (I am 5ft 9).""

Simona wrote: ""This is the perfect size cold plunge for tall people. You don't feel squashed and its more easier to get in and out. I have it on my back garden and it doesn’t take up a ton of space but still feels very roomy inside. The side drain is perfect for draining and being able to extend it to where I want it to drain. Thermal lid is a big plus to this bath, as it's keeps water cold for longer.""

A customer who originally left a three-star review for the Polar Recovery Tub due to a puncture appearing after a few months, later changed his rating to five-stars after receiving ""excellent customer service"". They said: ""The company proactively reached out having seen my issue with the puncture and sent out a brand new tub! That action goes a long way and, having been considering stepping up to a chilled unit arrangement, they are now top of the list.""

I've worn it alone as foundation and also as a powder over other foundations and both options look great. I now want ALL the LG makeup!! Finally something that works for older skin!!""

Another said: ""I'm 50 and don't like to wear foundation although I need it to cover red patches of skin and even out face tone. This make up is a game changer. It's so quick and easy to put on, plus looks very natural. I sometimes need to add concealer first under my eyes, then the mineral foundation on top. Superb. Worth every penny.""

Google brings its Pixel Watch Performance Loop band to Amazon,2024-12-31T13:44:03Z,"Google has finally made its Pixel Watch Performance Loop band available on Amazon. It suggests that Google wants to make its Pixel Watch accessories more accessible. The Mountain View giant announced the band at the end of November. It works with the Pixel Watch, Pixel Watch 2, and Pixel Watch 3.

It seems like Google designed the new Performance Loop band with fitness enthusiasts in mind. Google says this band makes the Pixel Watch 3 “your new run buddy.” This band is made of recycled polyester, nylon, and elastane yarns with durable stainless steel lugs. It features a “micro-adjustable” design that offers the right amount of stretch during workouts. While there’s no official water-resistance rating for the band, Google describes it as “workout-friendly.”

Pixel Watch Performance Loop band is now available on Amazon

You can find the Performance Loop band on Amazon in three of its four color options for the 41mm size. The colors listed are Peony (Polished Silver Stainless Steel lugs), Porcelain (Silver), and Wintergreen (Champagne Gold). Its fourth color, Obsidian (Matte Black), isn’t currently available.

The 45mm version of the band isn’t even available on Amazon right now. However, the 41mm model fits a wrist size between 137-203 mm, and the 45 fits wrists from 140-215 mm. Both are made from recycled materials with adjustable designs for a secure, personalized fit.

So, if you’re searching for a stylish and functional band to match your active lifestyle, visit Amazon and purchase the new Performance Loop band.

Google expands retail access for select Pixel Watch bands

Notably, Google has historically limited some of its watch bands to sales through the Google Store. Only five of the 10 bands currently offered for the Pixel Watch lineup are available for purchase at various retailers. These are the Performance Loop band, Active Sport band, Pixel Watch Woven band, Pixel Watch Active band, and Pixel Watch Crafted Leather band.

The remaining five bands are only available through the Google Store. These are the Pixel Watch Stretch Band, Pixel Watch Two-Tone Leather Band, Pixel Watch Metal Mesh Band, Pixel Watch Metal Slim Band, and Pixel Watch Metal Links Band.",https://www.androidheadlines.com/2024/12/google-pixel-watch-performance-loop-band-amazon-buy.html
Amazon's 'beautifully smooth' single malt scotch whisky drops 31% to £22,2025-03-08T06:00:00Z,"Amazon customers are singing the praises of a smooth whisky that has quickly become a favourite for many. The Tamnavulin Speyside Single Malt Scotch is usually priced at £32 but is now on offer with a 31% discount, bringing it down to £21.98.

This single malt scotch is produced in the heart of Speyside, Scotland's most renowned whisky-making region, and is double-casked for a rich, smooth and mellow finish. Each dram is said to include aromas of apple, toffee, honey and marzipan, with pear, peaches, pineapple and demerara sugar on the palate.

Its sweet, mellow taste and sherry cask finish are thanks to the American oak barrels used for maturation. This bottle has racked up an impressive 4.7-star rating after more than 8,000 Amazon reviews, reports the Manchester Evening News.

One happy customer said: ""I really enjoy this whisky. Smoke taste with a small dose of fruit. Drinkability is absolutely on point, not burning your throat, even one iota. Strength is there but not too strong. Taste, colour and flavour complexity is astonishing. Perfect trifecta. Honestly I think I found my favourite whisky. Just tipple it away and enjoy yourself.""

Another wrote: ""I won't pretend to be a specialist, but I like this a lot. I prefer mine with less peat, but with a little heat and earthiness/smoke, and this one delivers in that regard. While it mentions 'apple', I can't say I detected that, did I mention I'm not an expert? This is my new daily.""

Another whisky aficionado said: ""I liked this single malt, was a nice change from my usual choice. A smooth dram with robust flavour, I expect due to the double cask process. Bottle didn't last long though.""

However, not everyone is impressed, as some say the 'subtle' flavours fail to deliver: ""Average is probably the best word for this whisky. I bought it for £20, which is certainly very good value. It has that distinctive Speyside taste. But there is really nothing else about it, nothing to set it apart. It's pleasant to drink, but highly forgettable.""

The Tamnavulin Speyside Single Malt Scotch is now available at Amazon for £23.44. But for those willing to spend a little more, Glenfiddich 12-Year-Old Speyside Single Malt Scotch Whisky is available for £39.95 from The Whisky Exchange.

The heavy duty hose pipes are retractable, with brass fittings and a double latex pipe to prevent leaks and drips. They're complete with a sturdy on/off valve and can withstand up to 12 bars of water pressure up to temperatures of 45C.

Its expanding design makes it easy to use, while remaining lightweight. The Flexi Hose stretches to three times the original size then returns to its original length for simple storage. They also come with a lifetime replacement guarantee.

The Flexi Hose Expandable Garden Hose has attracted more than 43,000 reviews on the Amazon website and has an average rating of 4.3 out of five stars.

Many shoppers found the Flexi Hose to be superior to traditional models in terms of reach, power and ease of use and several people commented that it 'never gets tangled' or leaks.

One shopper said: ""I'd been struggling with an old-style hose that had been left and was SO heavy and unwieldy. "" This is a brilliant hose. Lightweight, absolutely does not kink, and no leaks. I have to admit that at first I thought it would never expand to the length of the my garden (which is exactly 50 foot) but it is like magic. And once the water is turned off and you empty the hose through the spray gun, it shrinks right back up to the original unexpanded size. If it's possible to love a garden hose, then I love this one!""

Mark said: ""Best hose I have had. Quality brass fittings, secure fitment, powerful/flexible head for different uses, never gets tangled, light and is high quality.""

And Antony said: ""Nice to use and certainly well made. Doesn't kink or tangle and the connectors don't leak or drip! Spray gun has plenty of adjustment styles. Overall I'm very pleased with this purchase.""

However, some people complained that they had to buy an adapter to use the hose with their pressure washer, as one reviewer wrote: ""Just come to use for the first time with my pressure washer but the brass connectors don't fit. I have a whole shed full of different connectors but nothing is suitable. I'll now have to spend more money to buy an adapter I guess.""

Shoppers can save up to 23% off the price of the Flexi Hose Expandable Garden Hose on Amazon. Alternatively, the Hozelock 2-in-1 Reel with Hose has been reduced from £59.99 to £44.99 at Screwfix, while this Green 25ft Expanding Hercul-Easy Hose costs £19.99 from B&Q.",https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/shopping/amazon-garden-hose-43000-reviews-31151098
Amazon’s Jeff Bezos paid nearly $1 billion for creative rights to James Bond,2025-03-07T21:58:57Z,"The name’s Bezos, Jeff Bezos. The Amazon CEO wanted the rights to James Bond and was willing to pay whatever it took to gain those rights.

In the wake of Amazon’s acquisition of creative control over the Bond franchise, The Hollywood Reporter published a piece on Friday about the tumultuous relationship between Bezos and Bond’s producers, Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson.

Recommended Videos

The most prized possession in Amazon’s $8.5 billion acquisition of MGM was the rights to 007. James Bond is one of the most iconic franchises in the world. Securing the intellectual property for Bond meant Amazon could expand the franchise through other avenues, mainly spinoff movies and TV series.

Please enable Javascript to view this content

However, Broccoli and Wilson, who had creative control of 007, stood in the way of Amazon’s IP takeover. After buying MGM, Amazon reportedly approached the Bond producers with spin-off ideas, including a series about MI6 secretary Moneypenny and CIA agent Felix Leiter. Broccoli and Wilson shot both ideas down.

According to a December report in the Wall Street Journal, Broccoli, the true gatekeeper of 007, was greatly offended when Amazon Studios executive Jennifer Salke referred to Bond as “content.” Broccoli even went so far as to call Amazon’s bosses “f***ing idiots.”

That “idiots” line didn’t sit well with Bezos, who reportedly told Amazon leadership to “get rid” of Broccoli. “I don’t care what it costs,” is what Bezos said, according to THR.",https://www.digitaltrends.com/movies/james-bond-amazon-jeff-bezos-paid-1-billion-007-creative-rights/
New Edition Of Popular Game Design Book Gets Big Discount At Amazon,2025-03-07T21:14:31Z,"Aspiring game designers can save on the recently released new edition of one of the most popular game development reference books. Level Up: The Guide to Great Video Game Design by Scott Rogers is discounted to $36.70 (was $50) at Amazon. This deal applies to the 3rd Edition of Level Up, which was published in December, a full decade after the 2nd Edition. If you've ever looked for game design books, there's a good chance you've seen Level Up near the top of your searches. Amazon's deal brings the price of the 3rd Edition within a dollar of the 2nd Edition.

Level Up: The Guide to Great Video Game Design - 3rd Edition $36.70 (was $50) Level Up covers a wide array of game design topics across its 600-plus pages, from creating design documents and optimizing gameplay controls to building levels and crafting a narrative that gels with the gameplay. The lessons are accompanied by over 400 drawings to help readers visualize the concepts. The 3rd Edition of Level Up adds two additional chapters. Since the 2nd Edition was published way back in 2014, the text has been updated to reflect modern industry trends and platforms. Level Up is geared toward designers working on projects for PC, mobile, console, or VR/AR. The two new chapters focus on playtesting your game and designing experiences for virtual and augmented reality. Written by industry veteran Scott Rogers, Level Up has been a mainstay on bestseller charts since its initial publication in 2010. Rogers has dozens of credits to his name across the last three decades, including God of War, Pac-Man World, and Darksiders. Beyond video games, Rogers has also worked as a designer on tabletop games such as Marvel Villainous and Alien: Fate of the Nostromo. See at Amazon

If you're looking to build up a library of game development books, there are several other titles worth grabbing, many of which are on sale right now. The Art of Game Design: A Book of Lenses by Jesse Schell takes a novel approach by presenting you with over 100 sets of questions for viewing a game's design, and Theory of Fun for Game Design by Raph Koster takes you deep into the influences that underlie modern video game design. Metal Gear Solid and Death Stranding legend Hideo Kojima also wrote a book called The Creative Gene that one examines how movies and stories influenced his work across the decades.

Some other books worth looking at are Significant Zero: Heroes, Villains, and the Fight for Art and Soul in Video Games by Spec Ops: The Line writer Walt Williams and Blood, Sweat, and Pixels by Jason Schrier. While these aren't about game design, they are invaluable for gaining an understanding into the turbulent video game industry. Wonderbook: The Illustrated Guide to Creating Imaginative Fiction is also worth considering--even if it is geared primarily at budding sci-fi and fantasy writers--as it's an accessible guide to building worlds within works of fiction.

Grab four Apple AirTags for only $70 at Amazon right now,2025-03-07T21:06:00Z,"Maria Diaz/ZDNET

The new year is a great time to score lingering deals, and the Apple AirTag 4-Pack is one big example. Amid rumors of a new generation of the Apple AirTag, we're seeing huge discounts making this the best time to buy the current generation. The Apple AirTag is one of those products I love so much that I must share it with everyone.

Also: Finally, Bluetooth trackers for Android users that function even better than AirTags (and they're 10% off)

I use AirTags to track wallets, keys, remote controls, and even my young kids. Over the past few years, AirTags have become this iPhone user's go-to tracking device since they're easy to use, small enough to slip in a bag or outerwear, and extremely reliable. And because there are so many aftermarket cases and holders made for AirTags, you can use them to track anything, including your bike, luggage, and car.

Also: How to find out if an AirTag is tracking you - and what to do about it

You can now buy an Apple AirTag 4-pack from Amazon for $70 -- about $18 a piece for peace of mind. AirTags are nearly $30 each at regular price, so this is a legitimately good deal. Plus, they don't frequently drop this low price (they usually are on sale for $75-$85), and this is a few dollars off from the lowest price we've ever seen for the 4-pack.

Thanks to my husband, who always forgets where he puts his wallet, keys, and even his shoes, I've gone through several different Bluetooth trackers. While I can easily solve his incessant forgetfulness to lock the doors and close the garage with smart devices, I struggled for years to find a reliable Bluetooth tracker for our smaller items -- until I tried the AirTag.

The Apple AirTag is so reliable for iPhone users that you can find out where it is down to a fraction of a foot's length with your phone. The iPhone's Find My app tracks the AirTag through Bluetooth, the Find My network, and ultra-wideband (UWB), a connectivity protocol that shows high-accuracy directional data. This results in highly accurate tracking information to help you find your lost devices within minutes.

Once I tried the AirTag, I couldn't consider returning to another Bluetooth tracker. The Apple AirTag is reliable enough to trust it blindly with my home's most frequently lost items. Thanks to how many AirTag holders exist for different devices, I use AirTags for my husband's wallet, our car keys, our remote control, and even wristbands for my kids.

I like to keep tabs on our younger kids, so I give them an Apple AirTag on a wristband when we go to crowded places. As much as I try to hold their hands when out and about, I have three kids and only two hands, so it's easy to find my rowdy toddler trying to escape my grip in search of shiny things or fun places to hide. While I tend to be hypervigilant of said threenager, having my kids wear AirTags gives me extra piece of mind during fairs and other crowded events.

How I rated this deal

AirTags are a popular Bluetooth tracking tool for locating keys, wallets, luggage, and more. But they're not always available at a discount, especially since they're Apple products. I've been following the price of this AirTag 4-Pack all year during the busiest sales events, including Amazon Prime Day, Black Friday, and more. ZDNET's rating system grants this 29% offer a 3/5 editor's deal rating. Based on my expertise, I've given this deal a 4/5 editor's deal rating.

Vax's best-selling spot cleaner that removes spills and stains is now on sale,2025-03-07T20:56:00Z,"Sometimes, standard vacuum cleaners and carpet cleaning products just don't do the trick. This is particularly true for light-coloured carpets or upholstery, which tend to show dirt more readily - especially in high-traffic areas like stair carpets.

If you've been considering investing in a spot cleaner to avoid regular manual spot cleans, a current deal on Amazon might just persuade you to take the plunge. The top-selling Vax SpotWash Duo Spot Cleaner is currently available for £89.99, down from its original price of £139.99, offering a saving of £50.99.

This portable device tackles spills and stains by combining potent suction with deep-cleaning technology. It also features a handy long-reach hose, perfect for reaching into the corners of upholstery items such as sofas and headboards, or even for cleaning curtains.

The package includes a bottle of Vax's own cleaning solution. The SpotWash Duo Spot Cleaner also boasts a self-cleaning function that rinses the hose after each use.

Additionally, it comes with a specialised pet cleaning tool, a Messy Clean Up Tool, and an Everyday Tool. With a high overall rating of 4.6 out of five, this spot cleaner has seen over 5,000 units sold in the past month alone, reports Birmingham Live.

One satisfied customer shared their experience: ""This spot cleaner is excellent for cleaning up spills. It offers good suction and collects enough dirty water that the carpet dries fairly quickly. The spot cleaner is also easy to assemble, has good cord length and is lightweight, so it is easy to carry around. Highly recommend if you are looking for a cleaner which can be used for spills or even clearing larger areas of carpet. This can also be used in your car to clean the seats; although I haven't tried this yet, I'm sure it would do a very good job!""

Another buyer praised the product, saying: ""Brilliant bit of kit. Make sure you read the instructions first as it will need to be cleaned and air dried before being put away, super easy to use and has cleaned my carpets well. I have used it in my car and the mats, so happy with the results. It takes no time at all for the carpet to dry. Super happy with this, highly recommend it.""

A third purchaser, who bought it for a special occasion, commented: ""Purchased to clean our corner couch and carpet on the stairs for the annual Christmas clean before everyone calls, and I have to say it was the best money spent. Everything looks good as new. We have pets in the house, and that was one of the main reasons we bought in the first place, so it is an idea, especially if you have big dogs.""

One customer shared their satisfaction with a product's performance in tight spaces, saying: ""It is good for the stairs. And small areas. But not the large ones. It is easy to use and also put away.""

Meanwhile, another shopper pointed out the effort required for its operation: ""Good for getting a small area cleaned up. Tried only on the carpet so far. Easy to put together and use. You really need a strong hand using the nozzle. Pretty good results.""

However, it's not the only carpet cleaner on the market. Shark has just announced a £50 discount on its StainStriker Stain and Spot Cleaner, now offered at £99.99 instead of the usual £149.99. This cleaner is ideal for various surfaces including upholstery, stairs, carpets, and even in-car cleaning. It boasts a dual-activated formula engineered to tackle food spills, pet stains, odours, and ingrained mud and dirt.

For those who demand premium quality from their cleaning gadgets, Bissell remains a respected name in the industry. Available at Argos for £229, the Bissell HydroSteam Spot Cleaner promises to handle the most stubborn messes and persistent smells.

Designed to work effortlessly across a range of materials such as carpets, area rugs, upholstery, car interiors, curtains, tile grout, and even footwear, this portable deep cleaner could be your go-to device for spotless results.

"The affordable Galaxy A16 5G just dropped, and yet it's already 17% OFF at Amazon",2025-03-07T18:14:07Z,"If you're in the market for a discounted Samsung phone, you're in luck. Amazon and other retailers have knocked 13% off the already affordable Samsung Galaxy A16 5G, even though it only became available in January.

Unlike the last-generation base-level phone, the Galaxy A15, the A16 5G includes six years of OS upgrades, although one of them is simply from Android 14 to the already-available version 15. Nonetheless, Samsung also put a larger 6.7-inch AMOLED display in this generation, sporting a 90Hz refresh rate and up to 800 nits of brightness, all of which are previously unheard of at this price point.

With this deal, you can get an extra $25 off this smartphone, despite the fact that it's new and is already under $200. For the budget-friendly buyer, this is definitely an option worth considering.

Samsung Galaxy A16 5G (128GB): $199.99 $174.99 at Amazon Multiple retailers have cut 13% off the Samsung Galaxy A16 5G, an already-affordable phone that also came out this year. From its 6.7-inch AMOLED display to the promise of six years of OS and security updates, it's pretty tough to find anything even close to these specs around this price point. The extra $25 off doesn't hurt, either. Price comparison: Best Buy - $174.99 | Walmart - $174.99

✅Recommended if: you don't mind going for an entry-level phone, and would appreciate an extra $25 off; you're looking for a phone with a decently sized AMOLED screen; having a smartphone with a large battery and/or a 25W charging speed is a priority for you.

❌Skip this deal if: you're looking for a phone with industry-leading performance; you want a smartphone with more than 4GB of RAM.

Samsung launched the affordable Galaxy A16 5G in January, and retailers are already offering early discounts on the smartphone. With 128GB of storage, a 5,000mAh battery, and a decent set of cameras, the A16 is a great budget-friendly Galaxy offering, especially including its improvements from the A15.

This generation offers multiple upgrades from the economy-level A15, including a 6.7-inch AMOLED display instead of 6.5 inches, and six years of OS updates compared to four—and despite the fact that one will upgrade the phone from One UI 6, based on Android 14, to the already-available Android 15.

Still, the A16 also includes an upgraded 2.4 GHz Exynos 1330 processor and an IP54 dust and water resistance rating, neither of which were included in the prior generation. It also comes with six years of security updates, and this deal is available for either the Blue Black or Light Gray color options.At under $200, the A16 5G already offered a solid bang for your buck as a decently performing phone, but those who love the Galaxy ecosystem and want an extra $25 off, this might be worth considering.",https://www.androidcentral.com/phones/the-affordable-galaxy-a16-5g-just-dropped-and-yet-its-already-17-percent-off-at-amazon
The M4-powered Mac Mini has returned to its Black Friday sale price,2025-03-07T18:04:10Z,"Apple might have just updated the Mac Studio with M4 Max and M3 Ultra chips, but if all you need is a good daily driver, they’re completely overkill. The M4-powered Mac Mini is probably the better option in most instances, especially since the desktop is currently matching its all-time low of $529 ($70 off) at Amazon with 256GB of storage. You can also pick up the 512GB configuration for $699 ($100 off), which remains the best price we’ve seen on the step-up model.

Even at its full price of $599, the latest Mac Mini offers exceptional value. The tiny desktop machine is less than half the size of the 2023 Mac Mini, yet it manages to rival the M4 iMac and MacBook Pro in terms of power thanks to its 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The base-model Mini also now comes with 16GB of RAM by default, rendering it more than capable of powering through everyday tasks.

In addition, the new Mini can run up to three displays at once, up from two on the previous model. It also has an excellent port selection that includes three Thunderbolt 4 (USB 4) ports, a gigabit ethernet jack, and an HDMI port. It sports a pair of 10Gbps USB-C ports (USB 3) and a 3.5mm audio jack on the front as well, providing easy access when you need it. That, combined with its futureproof support for Wi-Fi 6E, makes it an all-around great investment if you don’t mind supplying your own monitor, keyboard, and mouse.

How Amazon's Jeff Bezos Reached His Breaking Point With James Bond Producers,2025-03-07T17:09:22Z,"Divorces (usually) don't happen overnight, and the one that recently went down between Amazon MGM Studios and longtime James Bond producer Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson had been brewing for quite a while now. The super-spy franchise has always remained under the control of the Broccoli family, which is what made it so shocking that the two co-leads would be handing over creative control to, essentially, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. In the immediate aftermath, the industry as a whole has been struggling to wrap its minds around exactly what went down between the two parties and why the lifelong stewards of the property would abruptly step away from their family legacy. Luckily, a new report this morning may go a long way towards shedding some light on that.

The Hollywood Reporter published an in-depth, comprehensive look at Amazon's hostile takeover of the franchise (complete with artwork likening the famously bald billionaire Bezos to Bond super-villain Blofeld, hilariously enough). Amid all the juicy gossip and secondhand accounts of Amazon's plans for Bond after it initially absorbed MGM Studios back in 2022 (such as pitches for a Moneypenny-centric streaming series, a spinoff show about the CIA agent character Felix Leiter played by Jeffrey Wright in the Daniel Craig movies, and even some sort of project involving a female 007), the article pinpoints the precise breaking point that ultimately sealed the Bond property's fate.

Remember that behind-the-scenes drama between Broccoli and Amazon we previously reported in December of last year? You know, the one where Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke set up a meeting to discuss the future of Bond, failed to impress Broccoli in the slightest (Salke apparently didn't help by referring to the franchise as ""content""), and inadvertently led Broccoli to dismiss Amazon's suits as ""f***ing idiots""? Once news of that quote reached Bezos' ears, THR states that, according to a source, ""'[Bezos] read [Barbara Broccoli's] quote in [the Wall Street Journal] and got on the phone and said, 'I don't care what it costs, get rid of her.'"" What that ultimately ended up costing was nothing less than a cool billion dollars to get Broccoli to cede creative control over to Amazon and sail off into retirement.",https://www.slashfilm.com/1805868/jeff-bezos-amazon-james-bond-producers-breaking-point/
