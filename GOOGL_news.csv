Say aaah: Japan elects cutest hiragana character,2013-12-19T06:30:46Z,"The characters above should look very familiar to any student of Japanese. Hiragana is the phonetic alphabet that is usually the first writing system you learn. Compared to the much more complex and difficult to remember Chinese characters and the angular katakana alphabet, the loopy hiragana characters have a pleasant round feel that’s often called “cute.”

But which character is the cutest of them all? Japan weighs in.

The website Niconico News recently polled their readers to find out which character takes the cute cake and, with a whopping 21.1 percent of the vote, the clear winner is あ or “a”, the character that pretty much everyone meets first during their studies of the phonetic alphabet.

Respondents said the character “has a harmony as well as a certain assertiveness” and “feels like the main character.” One man said, “Not only does it come at the beginning, but it also starts out the word ai (love), so I love this character!” Preach.

Number two, with about 14 percent of the vote, was ゆ or “yu.”

“It looks like it’s curling up, so it’s cute.”

“It’s circular and starts off some classic Showa names for cute girls like Yuko and Yumi.”

“I think it’s got nice curves and a nice sound as well.”

And coming in third with 7.4 percent was ね or “ne.”

“It has meaning, not just a sound, so it’s the cutest!” (In Japanese, ne is used at the end of sentences to mean something like “don’t you think so?” or “right?”)

“When added to the end of a sentence, both the shape and the sound make it softer.”

“The sound is cute and the little twist at the end looks like a tail!”

What do you think, readers? Do you have a favorite hiragana character? And do you think they really look cute? Let us know in the comments.

Why reading their own language gives Mongolians a headache,2013-09-26T17:00:02Z,"Being able to read is something many people take for granted. I mean, English with its Latin alphabet only consists of 26 letters. Now imagine that the writing system (or script) of your country was changed for political reasons. Cities and towns across the border share almost the same spoken language, but with a totally different way of writing it down. This has been the situation in Mongolia. Drastic changes in scripts throughout the twentieth century have led to recurrent headaches for native readers.

I’ve met many a foreigner in Japan, or third culture kid who despite their fluent spoken language skills was unable to read. Here’s an example. A friend of mine who learned Bulgarian from her parents was visiting her native land. She jumped into a taxi, confident that she’d be driven to her destination, and fluently gave the address. The taxi driver gave her an extremely odd look. It turned out that where she wanted to go was right there, but she couldn’t read the signs to figure that out.

Spoken Japanese is fairly easy to pick up if you live in Japan, while memorizing the bare minimum of 2,136 kanji characters for everyday use requires serious study. And that doesn’t include the incredibly varied characters for personal names or place names. Foreigners who can chat comfortably in Japanese are a lot less likely to be able to read signs or menus, let alone newspapers. Let’s just say I’ve seen even native speakers sneakily looking up how to write a particular kanji on their phones.

Not being able to read easily is tough, wherever you live. In Mongolia, reading can be a huge pain for native speakers… this is why!

– “Ma, why do I have to learn my alphabet twice?”

There are currently two forms of writing the Mongolian language. One is the traditional Mongolian script (“Old Mongol script”) written vertically down the page like this:

The other is Mongolian Cyrillic, written horizontally like this:

Монгол Кирилл үсэг

Cyrillic is used in the state of Mongolia, while the traditional Mongolian script is used in neighboring Inner Mongolia (an autonomous region of the People’s Republic of China). You might expect that because Mongolian is now written in Cyrillic it’s similar to Russian, but in terms of grammar Mongolian is much more like Japanese.

Traditional Mongolian script is said to date from 1204, when scribe Tatar-Tonga was captured by the Mongols and introduced the Uyghur form of writing, originally written horizontally. Eventually, this became written vertically—Mongolians might say that happened because it was easier to write down the horse’s neck rather than across.

However, by the end of the century this would change. The Yuan dynasty of Kublai Khan (famous grandson of Genghis) promoted the imperial Phagspa script for the vast area they controlled. This intricate writing system was invented by Tibetan lama Zhogoin Qoigyai Pagba for Kublai Khan. It ambitiously aimed to be a script able to be used for all the languages under their sway, including Chinese, Tibetan and Mongolian.

▼ Phagspa script

In 1368 the Yuan dynasty collapsed, and as the Mongols retreated to the steppes, this writing system soon fell out of use and was replaced by traditional Mongolian script once more. The reason Phagspa disappeared so quickly could have been its privileged existence as a faithful representation of the language of the imperial court—it didn’t reflect how ordinary people spoke.

About 600 years later, Mongolian script reached another turning point. In 1921 revolution broke out, and by 1924 communist rule was established in the new Mongolian People’s Republic.

– “Workers of the world, unite!” Different alphabets adopted under Soviet pressure



▼ Latin script propaganda

In 1924, the literacy rate was below 10 percent. Mongolian script was held up to ridicule, and Latin script was named the alphabet of the revolution for writing Mongolian. Away with the old ways of thinking and in with the new—the traditional teaching of Buddhist parables gave way to educational reform.

From the early 1930s, there were attempts to switch from Mongolian to Latin script, but these early attempts met with strong opposition. However, in the latter half of the decade circumstances changed as continued use of Mongolian script was denounced as “nationalist” in the wake of Stalin’s Great Terror. Everyone was forced to support the Latinization of Mongolian writing, in fear for their lives.

In February 1941, the government gave an official green light to the use of Latin script, but the following month, these same public officials decided Mongolian should be written using the same Cyrillic alphabet as Russian. Clearly, there had been some kind of pressure exerted by Moscow.

In the 1950s, linguistically-divided Chinese Inner Mongolia also began to consider adopting Cyrillic. But from the end of the decade the Sino-Soviet split came to a head and cast a pall over this movement, which eventually sputtered and died.

During the perestroika period, Moscow’s grip loosened. People regained their appreciation for tradition, and cultural renaissance was in the air. A new movement to abolish Cyrillic and restore Mongolian script arose. In September 1992, education began in Mongolian script from the first year of primary school. Unfortunately, when these children reached third year, Cyrillic was adopted once more. In the face of harsh economic reality, the budget couldn’t stretch to train teachers and educate students in the vertical Mongolian script.

– Writing systems divided by national borders

As a result, while the state of Mongolia and Chinese Inner Mongolia speak almost the same language, it is written in totally different ways in each country. It’s possible that these writing systems may never be united.

The phenomenon of border lines creating linguistic division can be seen all over the world. A country which gains independence generally wishes to gain independence from the language of the oppressors and a distinct voice, especially if there is a shared border. Crucially, the changes in written Mongolian did not come about through the will of the Mongolian people, but through the political posturing of surrounding nations. Next time you come across a written English word that you don’t know how to pronounce, spare a thought for Mongolia’s differing systems of writing.

Waymos’s self-driving cars are headed to the cradle of the US auto industry,2017-10-26T14:52:03Z,"is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.

Waymo is bringing its fleet of self-driving cars to Detroit, a city steeped in car history. The Alphabet unit announced today that it would begin testing its autonomous vehicles in Michigan just in time for an icy winter. The goal would appear to be twofold: teach self-driving cars how to handle slippery, unplowed roads; and thumb their nose at the legacy automakers who are scrambling to keep up to Alphabet’s big head start in autonomy.

Starting in November, Waymo’s self-driving cars and minivans will hit the road in and around Detroit, the company says. And like in other tests, a trained safety driver will be behind the wheel to monitor the car’s progress. But it won’t be Waymo’s first foray on dangerously snowy streets: the company has previously tested its vehicles in winter conditions outside Lake Tahoe.

“For human drivers, the mix of winter conditions can affect how well you can see, and the way your vehicle handles the road,” said John Krafcik, CEO of Waymo, in a blog post. “The same is true for self-driving cars. At Waymo, our ultimate goal is for our fully self-driving cars to operate safely and smoothly in all kinds of environments.”

sending a shiver up the spine of Detroit’s Big Three

The arrival of Waymo’s autonomous vehicles may, however, send a shiver up the spine of Detroit’s Big Three: Ford, GM, and Fiat-Chrysler. (Though probably not the latter, which has sold its Chrysler Pacifica minivans to the company for its fleet.) Waymo made its first appearance in the cradle of the US auto industry last year, when it opened its 53,000-square-foot self-driving technology development center in Novi. Last January, the company took the stage at the North American International Auto Show to unveil for the first time its self-driving minivans. So it was probably only a matter of time before the company began testing in Detroit too.

To be sure, most of the legacy automakers are testing their own self-driving cars, but Waymo has a significant lead, having been working on the technology long before the company spun out of Google in late 2016.

Michigan Governor Rick Snyder used the occasion to recast the state’s place in the rapidly shifting auto market. “It’s great that a leader in autonomous vehicle development is going to expand its work in Michigan — the center of the rapidly expanding mobility industry,” he said in a statement. “Waymo clearly shares our concern for and commitment to safety for Michigan residents. I’m proud that Waymo chose Michigan to expand its testing as they take their self-driving vehicles into the next phase.”",https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552598/waymo-michigan-self-driving-car-test
X graduates Malta as non-Alphabet company working on cheap salt-based energy storage,2018-12-19T16:42:26Z,"For the past several years, Alphabet’s X has been working on Project Malta to create a new approach for grid-scale energy storage based on salt. Malta is now ready to graduate from the Moonshot Factory as an independent, non-Alphabet company.

The key premise behind Malta is salt-based electro-thermal energy storage to tackle how today’s renewable energy cannot be reliably and affordably saved for future usage. For example, Elon Musk and Tesla have turned to conventional battery power packs for both home and grid use.

Malta’s solution is to store electricity as heat in high temperature molten salt and cold in a low temperature liquid for days, or even weeks, until it’s needed. Malta uses cheap, common materials — like salt, steel, anti-freeze, and air — and a new engineering approach to “time shift” the energy from when it’s produced to when it’s most needed affordably and reliably.

Within X, Project Malta created detailed engineering designs and prototypes, and worked with utility, grid, and power industry experts. Malta’s solution is touted as being cost-effective, easily scaled, and can be placed anywhere. Additionally, it works with conventional energy sources like fossil fuels.

Electricity can be stored for the long-term (6+ hours) after it its converted into heat, and charged thousands of times without performance degradation for an estimated product lifetime of over 20 years. When the electricity is needed, the system operates as a heat engine.

The team, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is now graduating X as Malta Inc. to design and build a megawatt-scale pilot plant.

At X we support our projects through the early stage prototyping and de-risking of their ideas, and then we help them find whatever business path or structure works best for the type of problem they’re working on. In Malta’s case, we’re looking forward to cheering them on as an independent company focused on developing an affordable and reliable way to store renewable energy — something that requires partners with very specialized skills and expertise.

Malta is the latest X moonshot to graduate as an independent company rather than joining the Alphabet structure. Dandelion earlier this year focused on geothermal heating and air conditioning that is environmentally efficient. X notes that it is “continuing to look for new ways technology can be used to help reduce carbon emissions,” like Makani energy kites.

The toxic alphabet soup that almost took down Wall Street is back,2018-09-19T11:32:53Z,"Traffic passes the Lehman Brothers building September 15, 2008 in New York City. Lehman Brothers filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court after attempts to rescue the storied financial firm failed. Spencer Platt | Getty Images

In the years leading up to the financial crisis, Wall Street figured out how to spin relatively obscure activities into gold. What resulted was a jumble of products designed to profit off of the relatively mundane business of mortgage lending. From the mortgages themselves to products created to bet on risk and credit worthiness, soon enough, Wall Street had created an extensive and complex array of securities with funky acronyms, in some cases magnifying the risks two- and three-fold. Banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and others were hungry to partake, but what seemed like easy profit at first stopped working when borrowers stopped paying on their loans. Losses cascaded across the financial market, requiring massive intervention to prevent the banking system from failing. On Sept. 19, 2008, days after the failure of Lehman Brothers and the government action to shore up American International Group, the Treasury announced its remedy in the form of its own acronym: the $700 billion TARP. The Troubled Asset Relief Program would buy the toxic securities from banks and infuse them with capital to get over the crisis. TARP ultimately bought $426 billion of these assets and recovered $441 billion for a profit of $15 billion. These products haven't disappeared, though, and in some cases they are staging a comeback. After a decade of low interest rates, money managers are hunting for investments that pay more ""and will entertain almost anything,"" said Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance. Here is a look at the products that got Wall Street into the crisis, and where they are now:

MBS

The mortgage backed security was at the heart of the financial crisis but wasn't anything new at the time. The idea dates back to at least the 1960s. How it works is fairly simple: a bank makes a loan on a house, and then sells that loan to another bank, which bundles it with other mortgages to create an MBS. The borrowers make loan payments that create a predictable stream of cash, which is the basis for paying investors in the MBS. There is RMBS, for residential mortgage backed securities, and CMBS, for commercial mortgages, and even MBS issued by government-sponsored agencies. Mortgage-backed securities were the fuel that fed the housing boom as banks lent to homeowners and quickly ""securitized"" the loans. In the process banks were able to clear up space on their books to make more loans, and investors had another type of stable, income-generating asset for their portfolios. At the peak in 2006, nearly $1.3 trillion of RMBS was issued by entities other than the government sponsored Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. MBS was such a hit with investors, banks scrambled to create ever more product to feed them, and here's where the wheels started to come loose. MBS made mortgage lending seemingly less risky for banks because they could originate and sell the loans — and the risks associated with them — to the investors who were willing to take on that risk. But this virtue was also a vice. Mortgage lenders without any skin in the game (because they had offloaded their risk) had no incentive to make sure the loans they were making could be paid off in the way investors expected. They started lending to people without verifying income and other weak practices that ultimately led to a wave of mortgage defaults. Then the credit crisis erupted. In 2008, just $52.7 billion of RMBS was issued by non government sponsored entities and it remained low until the end of last year, when it finally topped $100 billion again. So far this year, it is up to $76 billion. It's different for the housing agencies. MBS created by Fannie, Freddie and the like stayed well above $1 trillion for almost all of the past decade and so far this year has reached $862 billion. Regulators and others sued banks over the creation and sale of RMBS products, Wall Street banks have paid tens of billions of dollars in settlements in the last few years.

ABS

Asset backed securities this took the idea of the MBS and applied it to other types of loans like credit card receivables and auto loans. Over the years creative-minded bankers haven even been able to securitize esoteric assets like outdoor billboard rental income and the royalties off David Bowie's music catalog and other recording artists. In 2007, $795 billion of ABS was issued but it dropped off after that. But lately it has shown signs of a rebound. Last year, ABS issuance rose 68 percent from 2016, to $559 billion. It is around $267 billion so far this year through August, according to SIFMA.

CDO

The collateralized debt obligation is a twist on ABS and based on a mix of ABS, residential or commercial MBS, and even derivatives like credit default swaps (see below). The value of the CDO is based on the value of these underlying assets. CDOs were constructed so that the assets they contained could be divided into different groups, or tiers (or tranches in Wall Street-speak), with separate credit ratings meant to appeal to a broader range of investors. Sound complicated yet? The top tier was the ""safest"" with the highest credit rating, going on down to the bottom. If defaults on the underlying assets began, the lowest tiers lost money first. But investors like banks, insurance companies, hedge funds and investment managers looking to outperform their benchmarks looked to investments like CDOs for better yields. CDOs were sold as instruments that could contain risk while providing high income. But when they faltered, the CDOs became impossible to sell and banks, funds and others holding them had to write off a significant amount of their value. Investors who bought the CDOs had taken their eyes off what made up the securities in the first place, the quality of the loans and the types of borrowers they represented, Tavakoli said. Wall Street also managed to magnify these risks by creating CDO-squared and CDO-cubed, taking specific parts of the CDO credit layer and ramping up the wager, often with derivatives. In 2007, more than $1 trillion of CDO were outstanding, according to Sifma. At the end of last year, $716 billion was outstanding, nearly all of it ($542 billion) in a subcategory called collateralized loan obligations, which represent bundles of leveraged loans to companies. CLOs have been a hot investment lately, with the dollar amount outstanding nearly doubling since 2013.

Google's founders visited Warren Buffett more than a decade ago - and were so inspired they modeled Alphabet on Berkshire Hathaway,2019-12-10T05:00:00Z,"Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin stepped down as heads of Alphabet this week.

The pair had the idea for Alphabet — a holding company that houses Google, DeepMind, Waymo, and other businesses — while visiting Warren Buffett more than 10 years ago.

""The genesis of Alphabet is a meeting that Larry and Sergey and I had about a decade ago where we flew — technically, I flew them, shocking — to Omaha, and we visited Warren Buffett,"" former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said at Alphabet's annual meeting in 2017.

Following Berkshire Hathaway's formula of trusting managers to run its businesses, Alphabet built a ""corporate scaling mechanism that we've never seen in the world,"" Schmidt said.

Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin stepped down as heads of Alphabet this week. They had the idea for the holding company — created in 2015 to house Google, DeepMind, Waymo, and other businesses — while visiting Warren Buffett more than 10 years ago.

""The genesis of Alphabet is a meeting that Larry and Sergey and I had about a decade ago where we flew — technically, I flew them, shocking — to Omaha, and we visited Warren Buffett,"" Google's former CEO, Eric Schmidt, told the crowd at Alphabet's annual meeting in 2017.

""I remember sitting on, I think, the 14th floor and being struck by the extraordinary success of his model,"" Schmidt continued. ""He had figured out a problem that had bedeviled all of us in our industry for years, which was how to establish scalability, right?

""He had a particular formula, which was the independence of the companies, strong CEOs, independent operation, and strong branding of those corporations,"" Schmidt added. Following the famed investor's example, Alphabet built a ""corporate scaling mechanism that we've never seen in the world,"" he said.

Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns dozens of businesses including Geico, Dairy Queen, and See's Candies. The so-called Oracle of Omaha trusts managers to run the companies with minimal oversight, freeing him to focus on the big picture and smartly allocate capital across the conglomerate.

Alphabet's bosses drew a few distinctions between their company's structure and its inspiration.

Berkshire has largely avoided the tech sector and focused on proven, profitable companies with competitive advantages, such as Coca-Cola. In contrast, Alphabet has invested in self-driving cars, smart contact lenses, solar-powered drones, internet-beaming hot air balloons, and other high-risk ""moonshots.""

""It's different types of businesses than in the Berkshire family of companies,"" finance chief Ruth Porat told an analyst at the annual meeting in 2017.

Another analyst asked whether Alphabet's management team took up a single floor like Berkshire's top brass.

""It's maybe a quarter of a floor,"" legal boss David Drummond replied. ""Ruth and I visited the headquarters several months ago in Omaha, and we realized that our Alphabet staff was actually much, much smaller than Berkshire Hathaway's.""

Page and Brin have taken pages out of Buffett's book before. In Google's IPO prospectus in 2004, the pair included a section titled ""Letter from the Founders: 'An Owner's Manual' for Google's Shareholders.""

In a footnote, they wrote: ""Much of this was inspired by Warren Buffett's essays in his annual reports and his 'An Owner's Manual' to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders.""",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/google-founders-modeled-alphabet-warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-2019-12-1029926618
Alphabet's X details its moonshot to build 'Everyday Robots',2019-11-21T21:11:59Z,"In 2017, X quietly teased its robotics efforts as being heavily machine learning-focused. Alphabet’s moonshot factory is now finally detailing the project and its mission to build Everyday Robots.

The Everyday Robot Project wants to teach “robots how to help us in our everyday lives.” It comes as the team at X believes that “we are much closer than ever to robots becoming mainstream” thanks to machine learning advancements, sophisticated sensor technology, and low-cost hardware.

As we’ve previously detailed, this program has a long history:

Advertisement - scroll for more content

Despite the huge waves Google made in 2013 by acquiring several robotics companies and 300 engineers, there is not much to show for it. A majority of these companies — but not Boston Dynamics — coalesced into a group known as Replicant before being absorbed into X. In late 2015, X head Astro Teller told employees they would be reassigned if robotics didn’t end up helping Google’s efforts.

In that time, X has come to the conclusion that “you have to teach machines to perform helpful tasks; you cannot program them.”

For robots to be useful in everyday environments we need to move away from painstakingly coding them to do specific and structured tasks in exactly the right way at exactly the right time.

According to X, robots are not only able to learn from repeating simple tasks, but then be taught new capabilities. The company is currently testing this with robots that sort through trash and make sure they are placed in the proper recycling bin at the X office in Mountain View. Sorting through thousands of pieces of trash, the machines helped reduce waste contamination levels from 20% to less than 5% in recent months. There are two takeaways:

First, they show that we’re able to create a robotic system that integrates all of the robot’s capabilities to do something genuinely useful: reducing the contamination levels to less than 5% successfully diverts waste from going to landfill.

Second, they prove that it’s possible for robots to learn how to perform new tasks in the real world just through practice, rather than having engineers “hand code” every new task, exception, or improvement.

Ultimately, the X Everyday Robots Project predicts that it “will be will be years before the helpful robots we imagine are here.”",https://9to5google.com/2019/11/21/x-everyday-robot-project/

"Google Workers Form Labour Union, Eyeing More Protests Over Working Conditions",2020-12-30T18:30:00Z,"More than 200 workers at Google and other Alphabet units on Monday formed a labour union for US and Canadian offices, building on years of protests over working conditions and business practices but falling far short of the support needed to force the tech giant to the bargaining table.

Backers believe the Alphabet Workers Union, which evolved from an informal group of activist employees, will better shield members from firings or other forms of retaliation. It will also enable the group to collect dues to hire support staff and attack the company more aggressively than in the past, internal leaders and outside labour experts said.

The union will be part of the Communications Workers of America labour group, which also represents employees from Verizon and AT&T. Alphabet members will pay dues of 1 percent of their total compensation.

Kara Silverstein, director of people operations at Google, said in response on Monday that the company supports its employees' ""protected labour rights"" and will ""continue engaging directly with all our employees.""

Unlike traditional labour unions in the US, the Alphabet group is a so-called ""minority union"" that will not be able to force the company to collectively bargain over wages or other issues.

Under US labour law, Alphabet can ignore the union's demands until a majority of employees support it. In addition, the union plans to represent third-party contractors, a class of workers whose demands Alphabet also may ignore.

Union leaders acknowledge that widespread support is unlikely soon. Well-paying jobs, with perks such as free meals and gyms, mostly have kept unionisation out of the tech industry.

But labour activism is creeping into the tech industry as workers and regulators grapple with the power of sprawling Internet companies including Alphabet.

Chewy Shaw, the Alphabet union's vice chair, said small fractions of the workforce successfully protested in recent years over workplace equity and ethical business practices. Those actions helped prompt Google to introduce new policies around workplace investigations and to drop a drone software project with the US military.

The union aims to mount similar campaigns, with the new funding and structure lending greater legitimacy and resources, Shaw said.

Google has been under fire from the US labour regulator, which has accused the company of unlawfully questioning several workers who were then terminated for protesting company policies and trying to organise a union. Google has said it was confident it acted legally.

Non-traditional unions of contractors or a small slice of employees at companies, universities, and government agencies have successfully pressured for changes for more than a century, said Joseph McCartin, labour historian at Georgetown University.

Shaw, a site reliability engineer at Google, said he studied unionising by small groups including Chicago public school teachers as well as staff and faculty at Tennessee colleges.

More recently, the Independent Drivers Guild, a 4-year-old group representing 80,000 ride-hailing app contract drivers in New York City, has won benefits for members around tips, disciplinary appeals, and rest breaks.

Drone delivery one step closer to reality with new FAA rules,2020-12-29T16:39:19Z,"CNN —

Amazon, Google’s parent Alphabet, and UPS all hope to one day deliver large amounts of goods by drone. New US government rules clear some hurdles to making that dream a reality.

The Federal Aviation Administration finalized new rules for small, unmanned drones on Monday that could pave the way for expanded commercial uses of the vehicles, including delivery services.

For the first time, the FAA will allow small commercial drones to fly short distances over people and at night without a waiver. Small drones will also be permitted to fly over moving vehicles under limited conditions.

In a change from a previous proposed draft of the rules, drone operators must also have their remote pilot certificates on their persons and ready to be displayed if challenged by the authorities.

The rules apply to drone operators who use their unmanned aircraft for work or business under the FAA’s Part 107 regulations. As many as 1.7 million drones have been registered with the FAA as well as more than 203,000 drone pilots, the agency said.

“The new rules make way for the further integration of drones into our airspace by addressing safety and security concerns,” said FAA Administrator Steve Dickson. “They get us closer to the day when we will more routinely see drone operations such as the delivery of packages.”

The agency said it submitted the rule changes to the Federal Register and that it expects the them to be published in January. The new regulations will take effect 60 days after publication.

The new rules mark a significant step forward by the US government toward a future of commercial drone deliveries, a vision outlined by Amazon as far back as 2013. Since then, the FAA’s development of drone regulations has progressed in fits and starts, prompting critics to worry that other countries could pull ahead and gain a critical first-mover advantage in drone-based commerce.

Industry advocates said there are still many steps ahead before that drone delivery can truly go mainstream in the US — such as opening up the rules to allow routine drone flights beyond an operator’s visual line of sight.

Those types of expanded operations “are critical to fully realizing the promise of [drone] technology to deliver innumerable economic and societal benefits,” said the Small UAV Coalition, an industry advocacy group.

Still, the changes could give a boost to companies that have all explored shipping goods via unmanned aircraft.

Last year, UPS and Wing — a sister company to Google — became the first companies to gain FAA approval to operate a drone airline. In August, Amazon received the same approval certificate. Amazon has set a goal of completing drone deliveries within 30 minutes or less of an order being placed.

Under the new FAA rules, small drones must be equipped with anti-collision lights and other technology to help remotely identify both the aircraft and their operators, according to an FAA fact sheet.

Pilots will also no longer be required to undergo an in-person training test every two years. Instead, they may complete the test online.",https://edition.cnn.com/2020/12/29/tech/faa-drone-rules/index.html

"Arunachal Pradesh is India's integral part, China giving invented names does not alter this fact: MEA",2021-12-31T05:19:11Z,"New Delhi | PTI: India on Thursday strongly rejected China renaming some places in Arunachal Pradesh and asserted that the state has ""always been"" and will ""always be"" an integral part of India and that assigning ""invented"" names does not alter this fact. India's reaction came in response to Beijing announcing Chinese names for 15 more places in Arunachal Pradesh which the neighbouring country claims as South Tibet.

""We have seen such. This is not the first time China has attempted such a renaming of places in the state of Arunachal Pradesh. China had also sought to assign such names in April 2017. Arunachal Pradesh has always been, and will always be an integral part of India. Assigning invented names to places in Arunachal Pradesh does not alter this fact,"" External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.

Bagchi was responding to a media query on reports that China has renamed some places in Arunachal Pradesh in its own language. China's Ministry of Civil Affairs announced on Wednesday that it had standardised in Chinese characters, Tibetan and Roman alphabet the names of 15 places in Zangnan, the Chinese name for Arunachal Pradesh, according to state-run Global Times.

This is in accordance with regulations on geographical names issued by the State Council, China's cabinet, it said in a report. Among the official names of the 15 places, which were given exact longitude and latitude, eight are residential places, four are mountains, two are rivers and one is a mountain pass, the report said.

This is the second batch of standardised names of places in Arunachal Pradesh given by China. The first batch of the standardised names of six places was released in 2017. China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of South Tibet.

The eight residential places in the second batch are Sengkezong and Daglungzong in Cona County of Shannan Prefecture, Mani'gang, Duding and Migpain in Medog County of Nyingchi, Goling, Damba in Zayu County of Nyingchi, and Mejag in Lhunze County of Shannan Prefecture, the Global Times report said.

The four mountains are Wamo Ri, Dêu Ri, Lhünzhub Ri and Kunmingxingzê Feng, it said. The two rivers are Xenyogmo He and Dulain He, and the mountain pass is named Se La, in Cona County.

The report quoted Lian Xiangmin, stated to be an expert with the China Tibetology Research Centre in Beijing, claiming that the announcement is part of the national survey on place names that have existed for hundreds of years. China's renaming of the places in Arunachal Pradesh came in the midst of the lingering eastern Ladakh border standoff that began in May last year.

Following the standoff, India bolstered its overall military preparedness along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Arunachal Pradesh sector as well. Eastern Army Commander Lt Gen Manoj Pande said in October that China has increased the intensity of its military exercises and deployment of troops in its depth areas opposite the LAC in the Arunachal Pradesh sector.",https://english.jagran.com/india/arunachal-pradesh-is-indias-integral-part-china-giving-invented-names-does-not-alter-this-fact-mea-10037166

The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488 km long LAC, and Beijing regularly protests visits of top Indian leaders and officials to Arunachal Pradesh to reaffirm its claim.

The eight residential areas in China’s second batch of names are Sêngkezong and Daglungzong in Cona County of Shannan Prefecture; Mani’gang, Duding and Migpain in Medog County of Nyingchi; Goling and Damba in Zayu County of Nyingchi; and, Mejag in Lhunze County of Shannan Prefecture, the Global Times reported.

Explained: Beijing aggressive approach

China assigning names of places in Arunachal Pradesh is part of its strategy to reiterate territorial claims with India. In the past, Beijing has always objected to visits by Indian leaders – Presidents, Prime Ministers and senior ministers – to the north-eastern state. In recent months, there are reports of China establishing villages along the Line of Actual Control.

U.S. Stocks 2021 Year In Review: “Big Tech” Shares Extend Their Run Of Dominance,2021-12-30T05:00:00Z,"With just a few trading days left in 2021 and likely to be subdued, it’s a great time to review what worked and what didn’t over the past year.

Looking at US stocks, there’s a strong argument that just about everything “worked.” As the chart below shows, every single major sector rose this year, led by energy and real estate, and even the lagging consumer staples, utilities and communication services stocks rose by nearly 20% on (a capitalization-weighted) average:

Source: Stockcharts.com

From a sector rotation perspective, strong performance by energy, technology, financials, and discretionary stocks historically suggests that we’re in a mid- to late- bull market cycle; as we flip the calendars to the 2022, traders should be wary if we start to see traditionally defensive sectors like utilities, consumers stapes, and health care start to outperform as a potential signal that the bull market may be peaking and a bear market may be around the corner.

Drilling down to an individual stock level, these were the top 10 performers in the and their sectors this year:

Devon Energy (NYSE: ) (Energy) +199% Marathon Oil (NYSE: ) (Energy) +151% Fortinet (NASDAQ: ) (Technology) +146% Signature Bank (NASDAQ: ) (Financials) +142% Ford Motor (NYSE: ) (Discretionary) +137% NVIDIA (NASDAQ: ) (Technology) +132% Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: ) (Energy) +132% Moderna (NASDAQ: ) (Health Care) +131% Bath Body Works (NYSE: ) (Discretionary) +130% Nucor (NYSE: ) (Materials) +118%

And, perhaps more importantly, these 10 stocks were the biggest contributors to the S&P 500’s impressive nearly 30% gain in 2021:

Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) (Technology) +55% Apple (NASDAQ: ) (Technology) +36% NVIDIA (Technology) +132% Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) (Communication Services) +67% Tesla (NASDAQ: ) (Discretionary) +27% Meta Platforms / Facebook (NASDAQ: ) (Communication Services) +27% Home Depot (NYSE: ) (Discretionary) +56% UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: ) (Health Care) +45% Pfizer (NYSE: ) (Health Care) +64% Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: ) (Financials) +29%

Once again, the megacap technology stocks drove most of the gains in the overall indices, leading to an even heavier weighting in these names heading into 2022.

"Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet drove the S&P 500 in 2021",2021-12-29T19:03:27Z,"This past year of labor shortages and supply chain snarls challenged the business world, but the stock market didn’t seem to mind. The Standard & Poor’s 500, a weighted index of the biggest US companies, is up 29% with just three trading days left, and while that’s not an all-time high, it would be the third best year since 2000 and surely the record for a pandemic year.

As has been the case for the last few years, the index was driven by the performance of tech stocks. The top five companies in the index—Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook,) and Alphabet, owner of Google—constitute 23% of the index. The next two biggest companies—Tesla and chip-maker Nvidia—are at least tech-adjacent, and information technology as a sector is 29% of the index, more than twice the size of the next biggest sector, consumer discretionary companies.

On one level, it’s no great mystery why the tech giants are dominating the stock market. Their products and services are ubiquitous, and while many other industries faced pandemic-related setbacks, companies built for a virtual world thrived.

Why tech stocks dominate the S&P 500

But on a more fundamentally level, the biggest tech companies earned their position at the top. Unlike the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, the valuations for Apple, Microsoft et al. aren’t based on the promise of future returns. They are enormously profitable companies, and offer investors both strong and predictable growth. Investors looking for a safe harbor are eschewing the bond markets in favor of big tech. And according to one analysis, the top five companies are slightly undervalued in the S&P 500 relative to their earnings.

The biggest tech companies are beneficiaries of network effects, where their size creates disproportionate advantages. The more users on Facebook, the more attractive Facebook becomes to new users. While network effects aren’t new, the cost of adding a new member is virtually nil in a digital system, allowing for growth without cost. The bigger they are, the bigger they get, leading to a winner-take-all economy. And as the companies grow, their profit soars, driving increased investment.

What stops the cycle? Government intervention may be the most likely obstacle to further tech dominance, but tech companies have lobbied furiously to prevent it. Apple CEO Tim Cook said increased regulation was “inevitable,” but that was in 2018, and it seems no more imminent now than it did then.",https://qz.com/2108056/apple-amazon-microsoft-and-alphabet-drove-the-sp-500-in-2021/

Video Transcript

BRAD SMITH: Everyone's staying with DC, but shifting focus just a little bit. It's been almost a year and a half since President Biden signed an executive order aimed at cracking down on big tech, part of his wider plan to promote competition in this space. His quote that ""capitalism without competition isn't capitalism, it's exploitation"" still ringing in the ears of the biggest players in the space.

So where are we now, and what's in store for tech major-cap companies in 2023? Let's get to Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley. Dan, what do we know?

DAN HOWLEY: Well, Brad, we were expecting to see something coming out of the spending bill, perhaps some kind of new legislation, but no such luck. We really didn't get anything as far as major changes from Congress this year. There's been large discussions about privacy legislation, whether or not there should be legislation improvements to how children's data is used online, but so far nothing.

Really where we're seeing things kind of take shape is at the FTC. The Federal Trade Commission is kind of cracking down on big tech in various ways. And, you know, since Lina Khan came in, who heads up that commission, she's really kind of looking to put her stamp on things, especially when it comes to the antitrust matters. You know, she's basically kind of made her name writing about Amazon and how that should be looked at potential antitrust issues.

So some of the major things that she's working on right now are obviously the effort to break up Meta-- you know, split off Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp from each other. There's that ongoing lawsuit. Then there's also her pushback against the Microsoft plan to purchase Activision Blizzard. She basically says that that would damage some of the competition in the video-game space. Microsoft pushing back extremely hard on that. Obviously Meta pushing back on its own issues with the FTC.

We have the potential for a DOJ investigation going on into Apple determining whether or not they're using-- or breaking antitrust laws. And then we also have, obviously, Google parent Alphabet. They're dealing with their own antitrust issues from a variety of state attorneys general.

So, you know, we're still kind of in this holding pattern where we were expecting some kind of change perhaps this year, but nothing really came out of those congressional hearings that, you know, essentially said that these companies were breaking antitrust law or there were potential violations of antitrust law.",https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/video/tech-regulation-expect-privacy-antitrust-164701600.html

"Futures rise ahead of jobless claims data, Tesla jumps",2022-12-29T12:19:19Z,"By Echo Wang

(Reuters) - Wall Street's main indexes closed higher on Thursday, led by growth stocks in light trading, as U.S. unemployment data signaled the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes might be starting to dent labor market strength in its bid to fight inflation.

All 11 S&P 500 sector indexes rose, with communication service and technology as the biggest winner with gains of nearly 3%.

""It's just relief,"" said Keith Buchanan, portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments in Atlanta. ""Selling pressure has been overwhelming the market recently and we could be having a break. That allowed room for stocks to move, and with lower volume (that) can materialize into a pretty good day.""

Apple Inc, Alphabet Inc, Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc, whose shares have been battered in the past few sessions, each gained more than 2.5%.

The U.S. Labor Department reported an increase in the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week. But the data indicates a tight U.S. job market even as the Fed works to cool demand for labor in its bid to lower inflation.

The yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell 2.2 basis points to 3.864% on the news.

The Fed's aggressive interest rate hikes have hammered equities this year, with the benchmark S&P 500 shedding 19.3% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbling nearly 33%.

The technology, consumer discretionary and communication services sectors - which house several rate-sensitive high growth shares - are down between 29% and 40% this year, making them the worst performers among S&P 500 sector indexes.

Energy shares have bucked the trend with stellar annual gains of 57%.

Wall Street's main indexes dropped more than 1% on Wednesday, with the Nasdaq Composite Index hitting a 2022 closing low as rising COVID cases in China and geopolitical tensions added to fears of a likely recession in 2023.

However, investor preference for high-dividend yielding stocks with steady earnings has limited losses in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is down just 8.5% for the year.

The Dow rose 345.09 points, or 1.05%, to 33,220.8; the S&P 500 gained 66.06 points, or 1.75%, at 3,849.28; and the Nasdaq Composite added 264.80 points, or 2.59%, at 10,478.09.

Tesla Inc shares rose after Chief Executive Elon Musk told staff they should not be ""bothered by stock market craziness.""

For 2022, Tesla's 66% slump and Amazon.com's 50% drop played a big part in the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector's 38% loss. Some $1.6 trillion worth of shareholder value evaporated after investors abandoned high-growth stocks with pricey earnings multiples.",https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/futures-rise-ahead-jobless-claims-121919164.html
"Google, YouTube content providers must face U.S. children’s privacy lawsuit",2022-12-28T20:39:19Z,"A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday revived a lawsuit accusing Alphabet Inc’s Google and several other companies of violating the privacy of children under age 13 by tracking their YouTube activity without parental consent, in order to send them targeted advertising.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Seattle said Congress did not intend to pre-empt state law-based privacy claims by adopting the federal Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, or COPPA.

That law gives the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, but not private plaintiffs, the authority to regulate the online collection of personal data about children under age 13.

The lawsuit alleged that Google’s data collection violated similar state laws, and that YouTube content providers such as Hasbro Inc, Mattel Inc, the Cartoon Network and DreamWorks Animation lured children to their channels, knowing that they would be tracked.

In July 2021, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Francisco dismissed the lawsuit, saying the federal privacy law pre-empted the plaintiffs’ claims under California, Colorado, Indiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Tennessee law.

But in Wednesday’s 3-0 decision, Circuit Judge Margaret McKeown said the federal law’s wording made it “nonsensical” to assume Congress intended to bar the plaintiffs from invoking state laws targeting the same alleged misconduct.

The case was returned to Freeman to consider other grounds that Google and the content providers might have to dismiss it.

Lawyers for Google and the content providers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The children’s lawyers did not immediately respond to similar requests.

In October 2019, Google agreed to pay $170 million to settle charges by the FTC and New York Attorney General Letitia James that YouTube illegally collected children’s personal data without parental consent.

The plaintiffs in the San Francisco case said Google did not begin complying with COPPA until January 2020.

Their lawsuit sought damages for YouTube users age 16 and younger from July 2013 to April 2020.

The case is Jones et al v. Google LLC et al, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 21-16281.",https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-google-youtube-content-providers-must-face-us-childrens-privacy/
"Jack Whitten’s ‘Lost Chapter,’ Now at Dia:Beacon",2022-12-28T17:47:22Z,"Courtney J. Martin, the director of the Yale Center for British Art, remembers seeing a striking painting by Jack Whitten at a family friend’s house when she was a child. It wasn’t until she began studying art history in her 20s that she realized that the painting, with its stark palette, striated surface and geometric composition floating in a strange optical space, was part of a series Whitten had made in the mid-1970s.

And it wasn’t until she began to think about doing a show of the work at Dia Art Foundation, where she was the chief curator and deputy director from 2017 to 2019, that she came to understand just how many of these works there actually were, and the significant role they played in the modernist giant’s career.

The suite, called the Greek Alphabet paintings because he used the 24 letters of the Greek alphabet as his organizing principle, number around 60 or so, and were the painter’s sole focus from 1975 to 1978. They represent a crucial turning point in his approach to his medium — a hinge between his colorful atmospheric abstractions of the 1960s and early 1970s and his more sculptural tesserae paintings of the 1980s — but they have never been shown together in any significant number.",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/28/arts/design/jack-whitten-dia-beacon.html

A LIST of baby names has divided the internet after one Redditor revealed her best friend's unusual choices.

The unidentified social media user shared details of the potential titles for her pal's newborn a post last month.

They wrote: ""My BFFs baby names. All are serious names she wants to name her future kids.""

The list included the names Hades, Orion and Seven.

For girls she is said to be considering Tempest, Raven and Danica.

But the list has left Reddit users divided.

Three were singled out as ""horrible"" by one commentator.

That included the name Alpha, the first letter of the Greek alphabet.

The Reddit user replied to the list: ""Ok, the only truly horrible ones are Tempest, Hades, and Alpha. Maybe Dusk.

""The rest are…fine? I guess? Orion’s kinda cool, Layla is nice.""

For others commenting on the list, there seemed to be a divide between the boy and girl names.

One said: ""A few of the girls names are okay (Layla, Raven, Danica and Adrielle). Every one of the boys names though….poor kid.""

Another wrote: ""Here's to hoping she has only girls because at least some of those girl names are normal lol.""

""Poor kids who end up with any of those names,"" one critic added.

But for others there were positives to the list.

One Redditor wrote: ""I really like Danica. Layla and Raven are okay, not my style but okay. Orion is okay I guess. Gedeon spelt Gideon would be much better!""

Another added: ""Tempest, Layla, Raven, Danica and Adrielle are all perfectly fine names.

""Hela and Damia are weird but I've seen weirder. Orion (I actually named my son this), Hades, Gedeon (stupid spelling of Gideon but ok) Alpha and Seven are all fine imo.

""Wolf and Dusk are kind of dumb but again I've seen far worse.""

A second, happier marriage to the painter Dillwyn Parrish took her to Switzerland. The rest of her life was spent in Napa Valley. Photograph: Janet Fries/Getty Images

Ella Rusbridger begins her introduction to this lovely edition of An Alphabet for Gourmets by recalling how and where she discovered MFK Fisher. She was 23, and it was 23 years after Fisher’s death. I was also 23 when, in 1990, I bought a copy of The Art of Eating, a compendium, for want of a better word, of five of Fisher’s best-known books, including the one I am reviewing now. Fisher was still alive then. So were Elizabeth David, Jane Grigson and Richard Olney, cooks who were also gifted writers. But Fisher was different.

Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher began her writing career as a teenage “stringer” – a freelance writer paid by the piece – on her father’s California newspaper, producing up to a dozen articles a day. An early marriage took her to Dijon, where she perfected her French and learned to cook. A second, happier marriage to the painter Dillwyn Parrish took her to Switzerland. The rest of her life was spent in Napa Valley. She wrote 27 books, including a translation of Brillat Savarin’s The Physiology of Taste, hundreds of articles for the New Yorker, and – during a brief stint as a Hollywood screenwriter – jokes for Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour.

An Alphabet for Gourmets: In one entry, MFK Fisher muses on solo dinners of an egg or canned soup, the perils of being a lone woman in a restaurant, and finishes with her grandmother’s salad of orange jelly on wilted lettuce, included because it is 'purely horrible'.

An Alphabet for Gourmets was first published in 1949. At the time of writing, Fisher had recently lost her mother, her brother – by suicide, and Parrish – also by suicide. She was in a miserable third marriage that had left her in debt, and caring for her ailing father and two young daughters. Fisher wrote that Parrish’s death left her a “ghost”; “A ghost, maybe, but a hungry ghost: a ghost who has no choice but to write, not just for art’s sake, but to survive,” remarks Risbridger.

Each entry is a thrillingly meandering riff, beginning with: “A is for dining Alone… and so am I, if a choice must be made between most people and myself.” She muses on solo dinners of an egg or canned soup, the perils of being a lone woman in a restaurant, and finishes with three recipes, the last of which is her austere grandmother’s salad of orange jelly on wilted lettuce, included because it is “purely horrible”. “J is for Juvenile dining” is a lovely essay about her five-year-old daughter’s developing palate, my favourite line of which is “she enjoys an occasional aperitif of Dubonnet or white wine with soda water (proportions about one to 50.)”

READ MORE

It should be stressed that few of the recipes would inspire a modern cook to grab an apron. Calf’s head à la torture comes with advice to procure two extra ears “as four make the dish much handsomer”. Garum (400 BC), simply calls for fish insides, salt and plenty of fresh air. A fond memory of carrying her Aunt Gwen’s fried egg sandwiches in her pocket lost its charm for me when I realised that the bread was fried too… I can’t even, as my daughter would say. But coming as they do at the end of each entry, their inclusion needs no justification; the joy of reading this book is in following Fisher’s train of thought.

As for the prose. WH Auden considered Fisher one of the great American writers. It took me several weeks to reread this book. Every few pages I had to stop and go back over sentences, many of which are paragraph-length, sometimes reading them aloud. Not because they lack clarity, but to figure out how the hell she does it. There are Anne Enright levels of syntactical gymnastics here.

Finally, a word for Ella Risbridger’s introduction: she was an inspired choice. Her 2019 book, Midnight Chicken & Other Recipes Worth Living For, is at once cookbook, memoir and elegy for the late partner who taught her to cook. She sees through Fisher’s irony and humour to the grief she carried as she wrote An Alphabet for Gourmets. And understands that it is an alchemy of time, place and the company of loved ones that makes a meal memorable.

If this tempts you to buy her book, I recommend the paperback; it comes with extra writing and, like most of the best cookbooks, no photographs.

Warren Buffett has tumbled from 5th place to 10th on the rich list this year - as Big Tech rebounded and he donated nearly $6 billion,2023-12-27T18:59:22Z,"Warren Buffett. Getty Images / Bill Pugliano

Warren Buffett has dropped from the world's fifth-richest person to 10th on the list this year.

Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Alphabet's cofounders leapfrogged him as AI and tech stocks soared.

Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owns almost 6% of Apple but has many staid businesses and stocks.

Warren Buffett was richer than Jeff Bezos and threatening to overtake Bill Gates in wealth at the start of this year, but he's slumped from fifth place to 10th on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index since then. His slide down the rankings underlines the stock market's shift this year and his personal giving.

Buffett, the legendary investor who runs Berkshire Hathaway, has seen his fortune swell by over $10 billion to reach $120 billion this year. That's largely because he keeps about 99% of his wealth in his company's stock, which has climbed 16% this year.

Big Tech stocks have materially outperformed Berkshire this year, boosting the wealth of their largest holders. Tesla shares have more than doubled in value, which has helped to lift CEO Elon Musk's fortune by $98 billion to $235 billion, per the Bloomberg index. Amazon shares have climbed 83%, which has fueled a $71 billion rise in Bezos' net worth. Microsoft shares have gained 56%, boosting former CEO Steve Ballmer's wealth by $45 billion to $130 billion, and cofounder Gates' wealth by $31 billion to $140 billion.

Meta CEO and founder Mark Zuckerberg, Alphabet cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison have also seen much bigger wealth gains this year than Buffett. Moreover, the investor has gifted about $5.5 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and four family foundations this year, having already given over half of his Berkshire shares to good causes since 2006. The upshot is that he's dropped five spots to the bottom of the top 10 rich list as several tech billionaires have leapfrogged him.

This year's surge in the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks — Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Tesla, Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia — followed their sharp declines last year. Buffett trailed Bezos by over $90 billion in wealth at the start of 2022, but overtook him by December thanks to Amazon stock halving in value while Berkshire shares proved more resilient. He was also just $3 billion shy of surpassing Gates in wealth to become the second-richest American after Musk at the end of last year.

It's not surprising to see Buffett lag behind his tech peers this year, given the intense buzz around artificial intelligence, and the massive rebound in growth stocks fueled by slowing inflation, fading recession fears, and the prospect of interest rates peaking and the Federal Reserve cutting them next year.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-tumbled-5th-place-185922112.html
Meet the Stock-Split Stock Warren Buffett Is Likeliest to Buy in 2024,2023-12-27T10:06:00Z,"There is, however, one stock-split stock that's historically inexpensive and makes for the likeliest addition to Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio in 2024 by Warren Buffett and/or his investing lieutenants, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler.

Typically, high-flying outperformers sport hefty valuation premiums. Many of the nine stock-split stocks listed here trade at aggressive earnings multiples, and would thus be off the radar of the traditionally value-focused Warren Buffett. It's why electric-vehicle maker Tesla, cloud-based e-commerce platform Shopify, and continuous glucose monitoring company DexCom, which respectively sport forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 66, 74, and 71, have no chance of being purchased by the Oracle of Omaha.

Even Wall Street's most-revered investor, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett, has north of $1.5 billion currently invested in a prominent stock-split stock . I'm talking about e-commerce kingpin Amazon, which has been a continuous holding since the first quarter of 2019.

Most investors hone in on companies enacting forward splits. That's because businesses conducting forward-stock splits are typically highfliers that are out-executing and out-innovating their competition.

A stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to cosmetically alter its share price and outstanding share count while having no impact on its market cap or operating performance. A forward-stock split is designed to make a company's shares more nominally affordable for retail investors. Meanwhile, reverse-stock splits ensure a company's share price meets the requirements for continued listing on a major exchange.

For the past decade, the FAANG stocks have been a staple for investors looking for consistency and outperformance. But over the past two years and change, stocks enacting splits are the ones that have delivered the bacon for investors.

When the going gets tough on Wall Street, professional and everyday investors have a tendency to seek out profitable, time-tested, industry-leading businesses to lead them through the storm.

Meet the stock-split stock Warren Buffett is likeliest to buy in 2024

The superstar stock in question that the Oracle of Omaha would be likeliest to buy in the new year is Alphabet, the parent company of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and a host of other ventures.

Even though Berkshire Hathaway has never owned shares of Alphabet, Buffett has previously expressed regret for not taking the plunge. During Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2017, Buffett admitted that not understanding the value proposition of companies like Alphabet and Amazon a long time ago was a costly mistake.

But after more than 19 years as a publicly traded company, Alphabet checks all the boxes Warren Buffett and his investing aides would look for when putting Berkshire Hathaway's enormous cash pile to work.

Most notably, Alphabet's moat in internet search looks to be impenetrable. Data from GlobalStats shows that Google accounted for an astonishing 91.54% of worldwide search share in November. You'd have to go back to March 2015 to find the last month that Google didn't tally at least 90% of global monthly search share.

Having a virtual monopoly in internet search makes Google the undisputed go-to for advertisers looking to target consumers with their message(s). It also affords Alphabet's subsidiary plenty of ad-pricing power.

Even though the Oracle of Omaha isn't the most tech-savvy investor, Buffett understands consumer habits very well. YouTube is attracting more than 2.7 billion monthly active users each month, and has seen daily viewership for Shorts (short-form videos often lasting less than 60 seconds) jump from 6.5 billion to more than 50 billion since 2021. Like Google, YouTube is commanding exceptional ad-pricing power.

It should be noted that Warren Buffett, Todd Combs, and Ted Weschler aren't afraid to invest in ad-driven businesses. This dynamic trio has overseen the steady increase of Berkshire's stake in media stock Paramount Global over the past two years. Buffett and his team fully understand that while recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle, periods of expansion last substantially longer. Buying into historically dominant, cyclical, ad-driven businesses can be a winning formula for long-term investors.

The Oracle of Omaha and his team also are big fans of companies that reward patient investors. Although Alphabet doesn't offer a dividend -- it makes no sense for the company to pay a dividend when it's aggressively reinvesting in high-growth initiatives, such as Google Cloud -- it does have one of Wall Street's most-impressive capital-return programs.

In April, the company's board authorized $70 billion in share repurchases. Since this decade began, Alphabet has bought back $186 billion worth of its common stock. These buybacks are increasing Alphabet's earnings per share, which is making an already fundamentally attractive stock that much more palatable for value seekers.

Lastly, the valuation makes sense with Alphabet. Thanks to the guidance of the late, great Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett and his investing team have developed an appreciation for buying wonderful businesses at a fair price.

Alphabet is currently trading for 21 times forward-year earnings, right on par with the forward P/E ratio of the benchmark S&P 500. What the S&P 500 doesn't have is Alphabet's expected annualized earnings growth of 19.5% over the next five years. Alphabet is also trading at its lowest multiple to forward cash flow since going public in 2004.

If there's a stock-split stock Warren Buffett and his team are primed to buy in 2024, it's unquestionably Alphabet.

Dec. 26 (UPI) -- In the 1960 western The Magnificent Seven, a group of seven gunfighters protect a village from bandits. Only three survive to ride out of town at the end of the movie. The odds look much better for the seven tech companies recently dubbed the magnificent seven after dominating U.S. stock markets in 2023. But there are problems that could ambush some of these companies in 2024. Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, Tesla and Nvidia have driven a rally in U.S. stocks in 2023. They now make up nearly a third of the S&P 500 measure of the largest listed U.S. companies, which has risen more than 20% since January. These tech stocks had provided shareholders with a whopping 71% return by mid-November while the other 493 names added just 6%. Advertisement

This impressive performance led Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett to name these companies the magnificent seven earlier this year. Goldman Sachs soon followed, calling their massive outperformance the ""defining feature"" of the equity market in 2023.

Advertisement

But as dramatic as this performance has been -- and although they're all essentially tech companies -- don't make the mistake of thinking they're all the same. In fact, the outlook for the magnificent seven next year is mixed, particularly in light of expected changes in their core markets.

Rising competition in the EV market

Let's start with the bad news first. Electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer Tesla Motors will continue to lose market share in 2024. While chief executive Elon Musk has been dealing with advertising problems on X (formerly Twitter), one of his other businesses, over the first three quarters of this year, Tesla has seen its U.S. market dominance shrink from 62% to just over 50% of the market. Both BMW Group and Mercedes-Benz Cars have expanded their footprints.

And over the next few years, the growing global heft of Chinese manufacturers looks hard to beat. Chinese EV players such as BYD, Nio, Wuling and Xpeng produced almost 60% of the world's EVs in 2022 - and they have been doing so in a very affordable manner. In the first half of 2023, the average cost of an EV in China was $33,000, more than half the $70,700 people pay for EVs in Europe and the $72,000 paid in the U.S.

U.S. President Joe Biden has proposed strict new car pollution controls that will require almost two-thirds of new cars sold in the U.S. to be electric by 2032. But the cost of EVs will need to come down if they are to achieve mass market appeal.

Sunny outlook for cloud computing

Magnificent seven members Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet make up two-thirds of the cloud computing market, which will continue to grow in 2024, although perhaps not quite as much as in the past.

Still, the market for cloud infrastructure services is expected to expand from $122 billion in 2023 to $446 billion by 2032. In particular, concerns about the macroeconomic environment have seen some customers focus on using the cloud more to reduce costs in recent years, although this has yet to have any meaningful impact on revenues.

And for Amazon in particular, there are some niggling questions around its outlook. Although its cloud business remains solid, its original e-commerce business has seen growing competition recently, notably from rival retail giant Walmart, which is eating into its business in the U.S.

This is one reason why holding Amazon shares provided an annual return over the past two years of -16.7%, as of early December, according to my calculations.

Unstoppable AI

Also linked to the cloud computing industry, California-based chip maker Nvidia Corporation has been the runaway success of the magnificent seven this year. This is all thanks to its dominance in processing AI workloads on the cloud. The majority of cloud players use Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).

But while its two-year return of 43.3% is the most impressive of the seven tech companies, there are competitors on the horizon that could nibble away at some market share.

Nvidia's nearest rival AMD drew attention with its latest chip offering in 2023 - it's betting the market will be worth $400 billion by 2027. A number of other start-ups are also developing chips for niche AI fields.

Can Nvidia maintain its dominance? If it does, its earnings will skyrocketalongside the growth of AI. But even if it loses some market share, the AI market will boom for years.

The outliers

For those keeping track, that just leaves two final members of the magnificent seven.

Apple Inc. -- the world's largest company by market capitalization -- consistently delivers solid returns: 16.2% over the past two years by my calculations. At the other end of the scale, social media company Meta (owner of Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp) is the only one of the group to have shown an essentially flat stock market performance over the past two years.

Advertisement

Although Meta's revenues and earnings have consistently beaten expectations this year, the threat of anti-trust legislation in the U.S. and Europe hangs over the company, as does an advertising market that is bottoming out. Both of these issues could harm Meta's revenue outlook next year.

So, the magnificent seven have all survived to ride out of town at the end of 2023, but it's as clear as a tumbleweed rolling down a deserted main street that not all of them are in for a leisurely horseback ride through 2024. Saddle up, partners!

Better Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock: Nvidia vs. Alphabet,2023-12-26T11:45:00Z,"Artificial Intelligence AI Robot Big Data Bull Market Stock Chart Getty

In the artificial intelligence (AI) investing realm, two heavyweights are Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL). These two are leading the charge in different areas and represent logical companies to invest in if trying to take advantage of the AI race.

But of these two, which is the better buy? Let's find out.

Alphabet is a much wider AI investment

First, let's discuss how these two tackle different areas of AI.

Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are widely used in AI supercomputers because they have created an optimized system for processing data. The demand explosion caused by the generative AI development race created unprecedented demand for its GPUs, causing Nvidia's stock to rise an incredible 234% in 2023.

Alphabet's AI investment case is a bit wider. Its generative AI model, Gemini AI, beats most competitors (including OpenAI's GPT-4) in head-to-head competitions. It also has a cloud computing division, which allows clients to rent out computing power and data storage for many uses, including AI. Lastly, the company recently announced a reorganization in its advertising division to focus on further integrating AI.

Overall, Nvidia is a one-trick pony, but its one trick has been incredible. Alphabet is a much wider AI investment, making it a more conservative investment. There's no winner here, as the two represent different ways to invest in AI.

Call it a tie.

Nvidia is growing at unparalleled speeds

As mentioned above, the demand for Nvidia's GPUs has been unbelievable. In the 2024 third quarter (ending Oct. 29), its revenue rose 206% year over year to $18.1 million. It also guided for $20 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter, so this wasn't just a single quarter of strength.

Alphabet's revenue growth was respectable at 11%, but it's not even in the same world as Nvidia.

Winner: Nvidia.

Alphabet's growth is more sustainable

One part of the Nvidia investment thesis that's often overlooked is how sustainable these revenue levels are. It isn't a subscription company (for the most part); once it sells its GPUs, its client likely won't need to build another system for a while. This could create a problem in the future, as demand for GPUs might (or might not) disappear.

Should Nvidia's revenue fall off a cliff, the stock will follow suit, as it's priced like its growth is permanent (even though it's cyclical).

3 Stock-Split Stocks Billionaires Are Piling Into Ahead of 2024,2023-12-25T10:06:00Z,"The first stock-split stock billionaire investors clearly want to own ahead of 2024 is e-commerce company Amazon. According to 13Fs, 10 prominent billionaires purchased shares of Amazon stock during the September-ended quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):

The outperformance of these nine stock-split stocks isn't lost on Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers, either. Based on the latest round of Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, billionaires have absolutely piled into three stock-split stocks ahead of 2024.

While there are some instances of companies thriving following a reverse-stock split, most investors are focused on high-flying businesses enacting forward splits. That's because companies conducting forward splits have typically out-executed and out-innovated their competition.

A stock split is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count without any impact to its market cap or operating performance. It's a cosmetic change that can reduce a company's share price to make it more nominally affordable for everyday investors (what's known as a ""forward-stock split""), or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange (a ""reverse-stock split"").

Though volatility is perfectly normal for the broader market, heightened vacillations in equities often lead investors to seek out the safety of profitable, time-tested companies. For the past decade, the FAANG stocks have served as something of a safety blanket for investors. But over the past two years and change, stocks enacting splits have also fit the bill.

Over the past four years, Wall Street has been particularly volatile, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average , S&P 500 , and Nasdaq Composite swinging back and forth between bear and bull markets on a couple of occasions.

Story Continues

The primary reason to own shares of Amazon in 2024 is the company's rapidly rising operating cash flow. Though Amazon is best-known for its world-leading online marketplace, online retail sales aren't responsible for much, if any, of the company's operating cash flow. Instead, investors are mostly focusing on the company's ancillary operations.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) looks to be its crown jewel. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early stages, and AWS is currently accounting for close to a third of global cloud infrastructure service spending. Even though AWS only contributes around a sixth of Amazon's net sales, it's responsible for a majority of its operating income.

Subscription services and advertising services are two additional ancillary segments that are delivering in a big way for Amazon and its shareholders. Amazon has well over 200 million global Prime subscribers, which is leading to highly predictable revenue and cash flow. Meanwhile, the company drives more than 2 billion visitors to its website each month. That's a tantalizing proposition for merchants, which is contributing to Amazon's top-tier ad-pricing power.

As wild as this might sound, there's also a value proposition with Amazon. While it's not inexpensive in a traditional sense (i.e., using the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio), shares are cheaper than they've ever been relative to consensus forward-year cash flow. Since Amazon reinvests most of its operating cash flow back into its business, cash flow is, arguably, a better valuation measure than P/E.

Alphabet

A second stock-split stock that some of the smartest billionaire fund managers want to own ahead of 2024 is Alphabet. The latest round of 13Fs show that nine billionaires added Class A shares (GOOGL) during the third quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):

Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital (3,113,001 shares)

Bill Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management (2,169,824 shares)

Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,523,000 shares)

Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,498,213 shares)

David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (1,195,541 shares)

Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (1,023,535 shares)

Israel Englander of Millennium Management (602,822 shares)

Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (544,495 shares)

Among the nine stock-split stocks listed above, perhaps none has a moat more secure than Alphabet's internet search engine Google. In November, Google claimed almost 92% of worldwide internet search share, and it's held at least a 90% monthly share of internet search dating back more than eight years.

Businesses wanting to target users via search understand that Google gives them the best chance to do so. As a result, Alphabet's foundational operating segment generates abundant operating cash flow and usually has phenomenal ad-pricing power.

Similar to Amazon, billionaires are likely also enamored by the growth of Alphabet's cloud infrastructure service segment. Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of worldwide cloud infrastructure service spending, based on third-quarter estimates from tech-analysis firm Canalys. This is a segment capable of sustained double-digit growth that's delivered three consecutive quarterly profits following years of losses. In other words, Alphabet looks to have found its next cash-flow driver.

Alphabet is currently valued at 14 times forward-year cash flow and 20 times forward-year earnings. Both figures are historically cheap compared to where Alphabet's stock has traded over the past five years.

Tesla

The third stock-split stock billionaires are absolutely piling into ahead of 2024 is electric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla. The September-ended quarter saw four successful billionaire investors add to their funds' existing position in Tesla, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):

David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (644,638 shares)

Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (603,898 shares)

Israel Englander of Millennium Management (407,695 shares)

The lure for billionaires to North America's leading EV manufacturer may have to do with its recent launch of the Cybertruck (deliveries began on Nov. 30). CEO Elon Musk previously noted that refundable deposits for the Cybertruck had topped 1 million. If a significant percentage of these deposits turn into actual orders, Tesla will have another key source of revenue.

Furthermore, Tesla is closing in on its fourth consecutive year of profitability, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Whereas the EV divisions of new and legacy automakers are deeply in the red, Tesla's operating model continues to shine.

However, it may not be all peaches and cream in 2024 for Tesla. Musk noted during the company's annual shareholder meeting in May that Tesla's pricing strategy is based on demand. More than a half-dozen price cuts for Model's 3, S, X, and Y in 2023, coupled with rising inventory levels over the past two years, suggests the world's largest automaker by market cap has a demand problem. The company's operating margin has been more-than-halved (17.2% to 7.6%) over the trailing year, ended Sept. 30.

What's more, Elon Musk has proven to be a significant liability for Tesla. Though he's overseen plenty of innovation, he's also come under scrutiny by securities regulators on a couple of occasions. Additionally, Musk has made countless promises regarding innovations and new products/services that have simply never come to fruition.

AI stocks that could boom in 2025,2024-12-31T10:00:00Z,"Big Tech stocks could have another big year in 2025.



Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Apple (AAPL) could continue to be some of the biggest winners of the artificial intelligence-driven stock boom, David Dietze, senior portfolio strategist at Peapack Private Wealth Management, said in the latest episode of Quartz AI Factor, a video series set at the Nasdaq MarketSite.

Shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia — “the granddaddy of them all,” as Dietze puts it — soared more than 170% this year, giving it a roughly $3.3 trillion market capitalization as it rides tremendous revenue growth and overwhelming demand for its AI chips. Shares of e-commerce giant Amazon, which is also getting in on the chip game, surged more than 50%. Google parent Alphabet stock rose 40%, and Apple climbed more than 35%.

The Magnificent 7 — Apple, Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) — have accounted for about a third of the S&P 500 index’s gains this year, largely powered by excitement around new AI technologies. But Goldman Sachs (GS) has warned that this “unusual degree of market concentration” could pose a major risk next year.

Stocks that have benefited from the AI boom have largely done so independent of interest rates. But that doesn’t mean they aren’t in for a correction as the market settles from the post-presidential election rally. Dietze said that could happen in the not-so-distant future.

“They’re riding a secular tailwind of extreme innovation that could plow right through that,” Dietze said. “Nevertheless, no sector operates in a silo or a vacuum. If everything else around them is struggling, they’re gonna struggle a little bit, too.”

Dietze said one major theme for 2025 will be: show me the money. While major companies such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet have poured billions into AI partnerships and their own initiatives, investors are likely going to start looking for proof of returns next year, Dietze said.

“Wall Street’s the type of place where it’s like, ‘Show me the money, like, yesterday,” he said. “These investments and capital expenditures are great, but when does the cash flow start coming in? And right now many AI companies have gotten a pass on that, but I think increasingly Wall Street’s going to say, ‘No, we’ve seen the capital expenditures, you’ve got the AI label, but now we want to see the cash flows coming in from that.’”

“And that’s what we’re gonna be watching so carefully next year,” Dietze said.

How Google proved it 'still has its mojo' in 2024,2024-12-30T11:00:25Z,"Under the weight of sweeping antitrust enforcement and intense competition for AI turf, Alphabet stock (GOOG, GOOGL) is enjoying a December resurgence. No Big Tech platform has risen so much this late in the year. And aside from Tesla (TSLA), shares of the Google parent are outshining the rest of the Magnificent Seven, rising 14% this month.

Back-to-back catalysts — from a quantum computing breakthrough to the demise of a chief rival in the robotaxi market — lifted shares in the final weeks of 2024. They punctuated a year defined not so much by transformation but by rediscovery.

“The stock market rewards mystery and open-ended opportunities and Alphabet still has its mojo — the recent announcements were a reminder of that,” said Michael Smith, senior portfolio manager at Allspring Global Investments.

By the numbers, even Google’s 40% year-to-date gains fall below the Magnificent Seven average of about 64%. The company’s stock price growth is well behind the chart-topping appreciation of Nvidia (NVDA), Meta's (META) powerful comeback story, and Tesla’s post-election Trump bump. But the gap between Google’s share price gain and those of the best-performing tech companies is partly why analysts see buying opportunities.

Google’s end-of-year rally also highlights changing perceptions of the company. Where earlier this year Google was still seen as playing catch-up to Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI in the burgeoning market for AI tools, Mountain View has since worked to even the playing field.

“People have been worried about the innovator’s dilemma affecting Google’s commitment to staying on the right side of change,” said Smith. “More recently, it is clear that Google has the capabilities to stay at the front of the industry.”

And while questions still remain about how well the company can monetize AI-inflected search without cannibalizing its proven business model, CEO Sundar Pichai has said that AI Overviews has led to increased user engagement.

“If we get more confirmation that AI accelerates search growth, that would represent a major change to consensus thinking and lead to more upside for Google shares,” said Smith.

"Driverless taxi passengers are facing unforseen safety challenges, threatening situations",2024-12-24T12:40:00Z,"Editor's take: Some riders of robotaxi services have been experiencing harassment from people emboldened by the absence of a human driver. These incidents raise the question of how emergency response protocols can be adapted for autonomous vehicles.

As Alphabet's Waymo expands its driverless taxi service across major U.S. cities, a new set of challenges is emerging for passengers who find themselves in unexpected and unsettling situations. While the promise of increased safety and convenience has drawn many to these futuristic vehicles, recent incidents have shown that sometimes a human at the wheel is necessary when navigating urban environments.

The Washington Post spoke with several people who experienced harassment while in these vehicles. One person, a tech worker in San Francisco whom the Post identified as Stephanie, initially embraced Waymo's robotaxis for their perceived safety advantages, particularly for women traveling alone. However, her perspective shifted dramatically after a harrowing experience one Saturday night.

As she and her sister were being driven home, their Waymo vehicle was pursued by a car full of young men who began catcalling and following them closely. The incident left Stephanie feeling vulnerable and wishing for a human driver who could have easily altered the route to evade their pursuers.

The inability to quickly redirect the vehicle's path in threatening situations has become a significant concern for some Waymo users. Stephanie's attempts to seek help were frustrated when a 911 dispatcher informed her they couldn't dispatch police to a moving vehicle.

In another unsettling incident, Elliot, a San Francisco tech worker, found himself face-to-face with a potential assailant who attempted to enter his Waymo vehicle while it was stopped at a red light. The man briefly displayed what appeared to be a knife before walking away. Elliot, who later filed a police report, said he wished that the vehicle could have reacted more swiftly to the threat.

Madelline, a 25-year-old restaurant server, recounted a late-night ride where her Waymo became immobilized due to a road rage incident unfolding ahead. The robotaxi's adherence to traffic rules left her feeling trapped and anxious as the situation escalated.

Waymo has acknowledged these concerns, noting that they are relatively rare. ""We take these events very seriously and understand how upsetting they can be,"" company spokesman Ethan Teicher told the Post. Waymo offers support agents who can stay on the line with riders during incidents and work with law enforcement when necessary. Passengers can also use the Waymo app to request the vehicle to pull over or change its destination.

Some users would like further protections, though, such as having greater control over the vehicle's route, particularly in potentially dangerous situations. And when Stephanie asked Waymo for video footage of the car that had been following her hoping to get the license plate, the company declined to provide it, she said.

Experts in the field of autonomous vehicles are not surprised by these riders' experiences. Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, pointed out to the Post that while robotaxis excel at following traffic rules, they struggle with interpreting and responding to nuanced human behavior. This technological gap has led to situations where vehicles can be easily manipulated or obstructed by pranksters or those with malicious intent.

The solution to these issues likely lies in a combination of improved vehicle sensing capabilities and enhanced coordination with remote operations teams, according to Missy Cummings, an engineering professor at George Mason University. However, Phil Koopman, an electrical and computer engineering professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said there are limits to what autonomous vehicles can be programmed to do, especially when it comes to actions that might violate traffic laws.

Despite these challenges, many riders continue to appreciate the benefits of driverless taxis. Madelline, for instance, still prefers Waymo to human-driven ride-hailing services, citing the comfort of being alone in the vehicle.",https://www.techspot.com/news/106079-passengers-driverless-taxis-face-safety-challenges-threatening-situations.html
Alphabet's Google seeks to revamp default search engine deals,2024-12-21T06:00:15Z,"The proposal is much narrower than the government’s push to make Google sell its Chrome browser, which Google called a drastic attempt to intervene in the search market read more

Alphabet’s Google proposed on Friday a loosening of its agreements with Apple and others to set Google as the default search engine on new devices, in a bid to address a U.S. ruling that it unlawfully dominates online search.

The proposal is much narrower than the government’s push to make Google sell its Chrome browser, which Google called a drastic attempt to intervene in the search market.

Google urged U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington to move cautiously in deciding what the company must do to restore competition, after his ruling that the company holds an illegal monopoly in online search and related advertising. Courts have cautioned against imposing antitrust remedies that chill innovation, Google said in court papers.

That is especially true “in an environment where remarkable artificial intelligence innovations are rapidly changing how people interact with many online products and services, including search engines,” Google said.

While Google plans to appeal that ruling at the end of the case, it says the upcoming “remedies” phase should focus on its distribution agreements with browser developers, mobile device manufacturers, and wireless carriers.

The judge found the agreements give Google a “major, largely unseen advantage over its rivals” and result in most devices in the U.S. coming pre-loaded with Google’s search engine.

The agreements are hard to exit, the judge said, especially for Android manufacturers, which must agree to install Google search in order to include Google’s Play Store on their devices.

To fix that, Google could make them non-exclusive and, for Android phone manufacturers, unbundle its Play Store from Chrome and search, the company said in its proposal.

Google would allow browser developers that agree to set its search engine as the default to revisit that decision annually under the proposal.

Revenue sharing

Unlike the government’s proposal, Google’s would not end revenue sharing agreements, which pass a portion of ad revenue Google makes from search to the device and software companies that present it as the default search engine.

Independent browser developers including Mozilla, which makes Firefox, have said the funds are crucial to their operations. Apple received an estimated $20 billion from its agreement with Google in 2022 alone.

Kamyl Bazbaz, spokesperson for search engine competitor DuckDuckGo, said the proposal attempts to maintain the status quo.

“Once a court finds a violation of competition laws, the remedy must not only stop the illegal conduct and prevent its recurrence, but restore competition in the affected markets,” he said.

Google’s proposal sets the stage for a trial Mehta will hold in April, where the U.S. Department of Justice and a coalition of states will seek to show the need for wide-ranging remedies, including making Google sell off Chrome and potentially its Android mobile operating system.

The government plans to call witnesses from OpenAI, AI search startup Perplexity, and Microsoft, according to court papers.

Prosecutors also want Google to stop paying to be the default search engine, and cease investments in search rivals and query-based AI products, and license its search results and technology to rivals.

The proposals aim to spur innovation in online search, where Mehta found Google’s overwhelming market share keeps competitors from gathering the search data needed to improve their products, and prevent Google from extending its dominance in search to AI.",https://www.firstpost.com/world/alphabets-google-seeks-to-revamp-default-search-engine-deals-13846456.html

Why YouTube rise from startup to juggernaut should get more respect,2024-12-19T11:46:47Z,"YouTube has transformed itself from a place to watch funny cat videos, explorations of dance history, and Charlie biting fingers into one of the largest media companies in the world. But, in 2006, when Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion , it was the early days of the online video boom. The staying power of the platform, which was founded just a year before the transaction, was still up in the air. Eighteen years later, investors in Google-parent Alphabet are now faced with a different, strangely positive kind of uncertainty. Could this sometimes overlooked business be worth as much as Netflix at nearly $400 billion? And now, where does it go from here? YouTube is just one of Alphabet's many attention-grabbing assets. Waymo, its robotaxi venture, has been stealing headlines in recent months with launches in new markets and a high-profile Uber partnership. Google Cloud, a primary focus of investor attention in the past half-decade, is back seeing an acceleration in sales growth , thanks to artificial intelligence, along with improved profitability. Then, of course, there's Google Search and the company's hefty investments into AI to ensure its foundational business isn't dethroned by upstart services like ChatGPT from Microsoft -backed OpenAI. Throw in a drumbeat of antitrust talk — and, most recently, the hype around quantum computing, which helped kickstart a furious, more than 11% December rally for the stock. With so much else for investors to focus on, it can sometimes feel as if YouTube is just streaming in the background on mute. But its financial and strategic importance, especially within Alphabet's broader AI initiatives, deserves to be heard at full volume. ""YouTube is an overlooked piece in the Alphabet story, but it shouldn't be,"" said Jeff Marks, the Club's director of portfolio analysis. Some of this dynamic is arguably Alphabet's own doing: YouTube's integration within the Google Services unit may leave its true potential hidden. Alphabet discloses YouTube's ad revenues, but it doesn't regularly reveal its combined revenue, which includes subscriptions to offerings such as ad-free YouTube Premium, YouTube Music, and YouTube TV, its cable-like streaming package. It also does not detail YouTube's profitability. Even without the full financial picture, some on Wall Street argue that spinning off YouTube could unlock massive shareholder value. And, while that seems unlikely, it reflects the media juggernaut's stunning ascent over the nearly two decades of Google ownership. GOOGL YTD mountain Alphabet's year-to-date stock performance. YouTube is the ""crown jewel"" of the Alphabet portfolio and possibly its ""most valuable franchise,"" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said in a CNBC interview. Luria touted YouTube's ability to expand user-generated content into a ""full-blown media company,"" while also competing in social media against the likes of ByteDance's TikTok and Meta Platforms ' Reels. YouTube Shorts was created, and it has become an important part of the platform. YouTube's wide content offerings — which also include video podcasts and live sports through its YouTube TV and NFL Sunday Ticket package — cater to a broad range of viewer interests. YouTube's one-stop shop format distinguishes YouTube from competitors, Luria explained. Indeed, it has come a long way since the days of ""Evolution of Dance"" and ""Charlie Bit My Finger,"" which were among the earliest viral videos found on the platform. ""It competes against the streamers, against the broadcasters, social media companies, but from a consumer perspective, it's one destination. That's part of what makes YouTube such a special property,"" the analyst added. Alphabet's dominant Google Search business has historically captured the lion's share of investor attention — and currently, it still accounts for more than half of companywide revenue. Google Cloud represented about 13% of sales in the third quarter but commands outsized scrutiny from investors considering it's a relatively younger business. It's the third-biggest cloud behind Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft's Azure. Google Cloud revenue was only broken out for the first time in 2018 and is now a measuring stick for the success of Alphabet's hefty generative AI investments. However, some of YouTube's recent milestones have been hard to ignore. Consider this: YouTube's advertising and subscription revenue surpassed $50 billion in the 12 months ended in September, CEO Sundar Pichai said on its third-quarter earnings call. That is equal to nearly 15% of Alphabet's $340 billion in revenue over the same period. Comparing that $50 billion figure to other media companies really puts it into perspective. In the same 12 months as YouTube's $50-plus-billion disclosure, Disney's entertainment and sports revenue totaled $58.8 billion. While we don't know YouTube's exact figure, it seems likely that Disney was bigger. But that's where the debate ends. Netflix 's total revenue in its current fiscal year ended in December is expected to be roughly $39 billion, according to FactSet. Analysts see that rising to $43.7 billion next year. Comcast 's content-and-experiences business — home to NBCUniversal and its theme parks, movie studio and cable channels, including CNBC — is projected to do $45 billion in revenue this year and a little less than that in 2025, FactSet data shows. Wall Street sees CBS-owner Paramount Global generating roughly $29 billion in revenue this year and next, while HBO parent Warner Bros. Discovery is estimated to bring in $39.6 billion in 2024 and $39.8 billion in 2025. Viewership data also illustrates YouTube's strong standing in the media landscape. In July, YouTube became the first streaming platform to break 10% of total TV usage, according to Nielsen. That month, Netflix was at roughly 8.4%, per Nielsen data. Elsewhere, a recent survey from the Pew Research Center found 90% of teens use YouTube — far ahead of No. 2 TikTok at 63%, and Meta's Instagram, in third, at 61%. Sports, AI and shorts As YouTube continues to convert its strong viewership into more dollars, subscriptions are a growing part of the strategy, analysts say. In Alphabet's third quarter, YouTube ad revenue totaled $8.9 billion, up about 12% year over year; that represents roughly 10% of companywide sales in the quarter. Exact figures on YouTube's subscription revenue were not disclosed for the quarter. What the company did say, though, was it generated $10.7 billion in ""subscription, platforms and devices"" revenue, up 28% on an annual basis. ""We continue to have significant growth in our subscription products, driven primarily by YouTube TV and YouTube Music, Premium, as well as Google One, primarily due to increases in the number of paid subscribers,"" CFO Anat Ashkenazi said on the call. Ben Reitzes, analyst at Melius Research, said YouTube's subscriptions are going to be a key driver that grows ""much faster than the ad business."" The ad-free YouTube Premium and cable competitor YouTube TV appeal to cord-cutters who are looking for cost-effective alternatives to traditional pay-TV packages. Reitzes described these recurring revenue streams as ""predictable and sustainable,"" positioning subscriptions as the backbone of YouTube's monetization strategy. While YouTube TV is getting a little less cost-effective for subscribers, it should be good for the bottom line, assuming it does not lead to elevated churn or a major slowdown in new members coming onto the platform. Starting Jan. 13, the monthly price of YouTube TV's base package will increase to $82.99 to help ""keep up with rising content costs,"" the company said . The company's previous price hike to $72.99 a month went into effect in April 2023 . The YouTube TV subscription has had a series of price increases from when it first rolled out at $35 a month in 2017. A key to bolstering subscriptions is live sports, with NFL Sunday Ticket, in particular, representing a major draw for consumers. ""If you're competing for viewer time, you have to be in sports,"" D.A. Davidson's Luria said, calling it ""one of the most effective ways to drive user engagement and attract valuable advertising."" Reitzes echoed this sentiment, noting that YouTube TV's sports offerings cater to the next generation of viewers. Sports on YouTube TV ""will make more people subscribe,"" he added. ""There's no end in sight for sports to be able to stream live."" Alphabet is nearing the end of the second season of a seven-year deal, worth $2 billion annually , for Sunday Ticket, which allows football fans to watch out-of-market games on CBS and Fox. Jim Cramer has described the NFL Sunday Ticket as the ""most valuable advertising real estate."" But he has also criticized Alphabet executives' messaging on the benefits of the package, suggesting that it prevents investors from fully appreciating its value. ""YouTube is doing incredibly well. They got the NFL [Sunday Ticket] rights. They don't talk about it"" nearly enough, Jim said Monday. In addition to live sports, generative AI figures to have a bigger role in YouTube's future. As the entire media world grapples with that gathering force, YouTube has the advantage of being owned by one of the world's largest technology companies with a strong track record of AI innovation . YouTube stands to benefit both on the content creation side and the monetization side through increased ad sales, analysts say. AI will further ""enhance YouTube's content ecosystem by helping creators produce more videos,"" Reitzes said. In turn, AI-generated videos and tools will lead to more opportunities to show ads. This strategy, Reitzes said, is essential as YouTube faces increasing competition from digital heavyweights including Amazon and Netflix. YouTube Shorts, another AI-powered tool, complements this effort by enabling quick content production. Already, 70% of YouTube's monthly active channels are uploading shorts, with more than 70 billion daily views. It's quickly becoming a prime spot for advertisers. What's it all worth? YouTube clearly has a lot going for it. What's less clear is whether that's fully appreciated by Wall Street as part of the larger Alphabet, which currently has a market capitalization of around $2.4 trillion. In general, it's not uncommon for investors to ponder what an attractive business owned by a sprawling corporate parent could be worth on its own. Fellow Club holding Honeywell and its aerospace business is a t imely example . When doing this thought exercise for YouTube, Netflix is a common point of reference. YouTube ""could be worth as much as Netflix's $400 billion valuation considering it gets more eyeballs in the United States and generates similar revenues,"" the Club's Marks said. Similarly, in a note to clients earlier this year, MoffettNathansen estimated that YouTube could be valued between $360 billion to $400 billion, based on a comparison of the platform to peers like Meta and Netflix. Any sort of head-to-head comparison, however, is difficult without fully knowing YouTube's margins and overall profitability. But on this point, it's worth noting that YouTube benefits from so much of its content being created by other people and media organizations. On the YouTube TV side, there are costs associated with broadcast rights and distribution agreements — recall, ""rising content costs"" is the stated reason for the looming price jump. The clear advantage is on the traditional YouTube side, where creators upload their content to the platform and receive a cut of the ad dollars shown before and sometimes during their videos. That's in stark contrast to Netflix, which produces many shows and movies in-house and takes on those associated costs ahead of time. There's also the reality that as much as some investors might dream about the chance of owning YouTube as a standalone company, it's probably not going to happen any time soon — if ever. Reitzes said Alphabet may argue against spinning off YouTube, given the platform's ""synergistic"" role in the company's broader AI strategy. YouTube's vast user-generated data can be leveraged to train large language models (LLMs), which underpin generative AI applications and enhance AI initiatives across Alphabet's portfolio as a result, Reitzes argued. He added that YouTube's data can be used to improve the performance and user experience of Google Search — and vice versa. ""When a user searches for things [on Google], the YouTube integration drives more people to YouTube,"" Reitzes explained. By understanding user behavior on YouTube, Google can deliver better content recommendations and personalize user interactions across its platforms. The main takeaway: Some portion of YouTube's value is derived from its common ownership within Google. In theory, another route to a standalone YouTube could be a forced divestiture as part of an antitrust enforcement action. And yet, despite YouTube's mounting importance to the Alphabet investment story, the platform has not been in the crosshairs of the Justice Department's ongoing antitrust battle against Google. The DOJ's proposed remedies in its successful case over Google's search-engine dominance are focused on splitting off other properties, such as the Chrome internet browser and the Android operating system, as well as prohibitions on its default search agreements with companies such as Apple and Samsung. Alphabet has criticized the remedy proposals and plans to appeal the judge's initial verdict, as well. Still, should pressure mount on Alphabet to break off YouTube – whether from the DOJ or an activist investor – Luria believes it would ""unlock shareholder value."" Then again, YouTube's value has soared during its time under Alphabet's roof. And, as YouTube approaches its 20th birthday, it has all the tools and eyeballs necessary to deliver even more while staying put. For Alphabet shareholders, either outcome would be a win.

Alphabet-spinoff SandboxAQ valued at $5.3 billion after $300 million fundraising,2024-12-18T15:43:33Z,"By Priyanka G and Krystal Hu

(Reuters) -SandboxAQ said on Wednesday it has raised more than $300 million in funding, valuing the startup spun off from Alphabet at $5.6 billion, as it aims to fast-track the development of advanced artificial intelligence systems for computation.

The new funding, from investors including New York-based investment firm Fred Alger Management, T. Rowe Price, and Breyer Capital, will be used to accelerate the development of its large quantitative models (LQMs) and other AI applications in industries from healthcare to finance.

This follows a $500 million fundraising last year to build its quantum computing platform to serve business customers.

SandboxAQ says its AI technology differs from the large language models that power ChatGPT in the generative AI wave. Instead of training on a huge number of language tokens, its models train on large numerical data.

""The majority of the economy is actually not based on language. It's actually based on quantitative relationships,"" said Jack Hidary, CEO at SandboxAQ.

The Palo Alto, California-based company plans to invest the capital in building news modules for specific use cases for big enterprise customers, from drug discovery to materials science, Hidary said.

Breyer Capital founder and CEO Jim Breyer, an early backer in SandboxAQ, said the company can train quantitative models on existing hardware like Nvidia GPUs. It could also benefit from future breakthroughs in the quantum chip space.

Google, for example, said earlier this month that its new chip called Willow has overcome a key challenge in quantum computing, prompting its shares to jump.

SandboxAQ was spun off from Alphabet as an independent startup in 2022, with former Google Chief Executive Eric Schmidt as chairman. The company caters to various sectors such as cybersecurity, encryption and life sciences.

Alphabet’s Wing will deliver DoorDash by drone in Dallas-Fort Worth,2024-12-18T15:00:00Z,"Wing, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet, is expanding its drone delivery service to DoorDash customers in the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex. Starting today, 50 merchants from malls in Frisco and Fort Worth will be available for drone delivery through the DoorDash app, dropping meals and items to homes “in as little as 15 minutes,” according to Wing.

The drones can fly at up to 65mph and reach a cruising height of about 150 feet before stopping to hover and safely lower orders to the ground at their delivery destinations. DoorDash customers will need an “eligible address” in Dallas-Fort Worth for the drone delivery option to appear on the checkout page. Locals can check the Wing website to see if they qualify.

This option will only appear at the DoorDash checkout if the order is being delivered within the service catchment area. Image: DoorDash / Wing

Wing says the company has now completed more than 400,000 commercial deliveries worldwide following its first US pilot in 2019.

Why Alphabet stock fell 17% in February,2025-03-06T23:38:00Z,"The stock fell early in the month on the earnings report and at the end of February as part of a broader sell-off in the market.

This article was originally published on Fool.com. All figures quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated.

Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is well established as a tech leader and is one of the most valuable companies in the world. However, the stock is still vulnerable to the same kinds of macro-level risks as the rest of the stock market, and in February, a combination of weaker-than-expected revenue in its fourth-quarter earnings report and broader worries around the global economy sent the stock tumbling. By the end of the month, Alphabet had lost 17%, according to data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, erasing more than $300 billion in market value from the company.

As the chart below shows, the stock fell early in the month on the earnings report and at the end of February as part of a broader sell-off in the market.

Q4 results underwhelm

For the fourth quarter, Alphabet's revenue grew 12% to $96.47 billion, though that was below estimates at $96.67 billion. It was also notably slower than rival Meta Platforms' growth, showing that the Google parent appears to be losing market share to its largest digital advertising competitor. The figure also represented a slowdown from earlier in the year.

On the bottom line, earnings per share rose from $1.64 to $2.15, which was slightly ahead of the consensus at $2.13.

Alphabet doesn't give full guidance, but investors seemed skeptical about its plans to ramp up capital expenditures to $75 billion in 2025 from $52.4 billion in 2024 to invest in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure as it's not clear that that's currently driving significant revenue for the company.

Later in the month, Alphabet pulled back again in line with a broader sell-off in the market on macro and tech sector issues. Tech stocks fell on reports that Microsoft was canceling some data center leases, and after Nvidia stock sold off in spite of solid earnings report, indicating that investors may believe that AI stocks had gotten overvalued.

Additionally, tariff threats seemed to push stock lower. Google also announced job cuts in its cloud division, which could improve profits, but may also be a sign of slowing growth.

What's next for Alphabet

As the leader in digital advertising, Alphabet is sensitive to global economic growth and business spending, and in a recession, companies tend to cut back on advertising spending first so investors should expect the stock to move on macro news.

Additionally, while the company has stood its ground in the AI race, there is still some concern that its search leadership is vulnerable to competition from OpenAI and others.

However, those concerns seem priced in and the stock looks cheap at a price-to-earnings ratio of just 21.5. If Alphabet can maintain its current growth rate, the stock should move higher from here.

"Big Tech, Data privacy rules differ over online tracking of children on Net",2025-03-05T18:30:00Z,"New Delhi: Meta Platforms Inc and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc have raised concerns about Indian rules barring tech giants from monitoring internet browsing by children under 18 as it will make safety filters ineffective, according to three executives privy to the discussions.

“The DPDP Act’s rules include an exemption that allows social media intermediaries to use the age of a user as part of the data that the platform can use to identify them. But, simply using age would not be enough to enforce safety filters, such as preventing unrelated adults from contacting underage users online,"" a senior executive at a top Big Tech firm told Mint, requesting anonymity.

“While the aspect of respecting a user’s privacy is necessary, there needs to be some form of risk- or harm-based approach to regulating children’s sanctity online—which is one of the biggest challenges that India’s privacy law will pose,"" the executive said.

Google, Meta and the ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity) did not immediately respond to emailed queries.

The response during the consultation process to formulate rules for the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 signals lack of consensus even two years after the Indian Parliament passed the law. The Act, aimed at safeguarding the personal data of India’s 1.4 billion-plus citizens, is still to be enacted as the final rules are being drafted.

The draft rules of the Act were published at the start of this year. Public consultations began in January and were scheduled to end on 15 February, but were extended until Wednesday.

“We’re not looking to extend the consultation period any further and will take all the feedback we have received to process the required information now,"" a senior government official said on the condition of anonymity. “If the overall consultation necessitates any changes to the rules of the Act, we’ll then take it to all involved ministries, before notifying them and enforcing the Act.""

Three officials with direct knowledge of the matter, including the one cited above, said that the entire process, including any tweaks to the privacy law rules, will take “about two to three months"".

AI training, data localization worries

Deliberations, including questions about the government being granted blanket exemptions to track users without disclosing it to them in the name of national security, have drawn the discussions out for long.

Meta and Alphabet have also expressed reservations about data localization and limiting the use of publicly available personal information to train artificial intelligence (AI) models—a key part of operations for technology firms today.

The Big Tech executive quoted earlier cited the example of Wikipedia, which holds personally identifiable data of various personalities. “Under the tenets of the current law and its proposed rules, Wikipedia—which is a venerable resource for anyone training AI models—will be banned as an information source since no company can access its information without gaining express consent from the users themselves.""

Another executive working with a different Big Tech firm stressed on revisiting India’s ‘whitelisting’ approach to data localization. “It’s important to note that imposing mandatory localization by policymakers may not fully appreciate the technical challenges associated with the process,"" the executive said.

Besides, the rules necessitate that only an individual can share their own data with technology companies. “This essentially means that an individual would not be legally permitted to share their aging parents’ contact information with an online platform—which is a necessity in today’s fragmented society,"" the executive said. “This, once the law is enforced on ground, would mean that e-commerce platforms would not be able to allow users to place online shopping orders for any other individuals.""

According to this executive, by structure, seeking consent every time from every user would vastly add to liability, and is also not permitted as per the current Act and its rules. “This could be a big detriment—one that the IT ministry will likely need to look into imminently.""

Legal view

Lawyers, too, view child safety as the biggest challenge that India’s privacy law has left unanswered.

“Many platforms deploy online safety technologies that protect against real-world harms caused by digital interactions, such as ‘text classification systems’ to detect predatory behaviour and cyber bullying. The mechanism of child safety systems often involves monitoring online user activity, flagging, and content classification without immediately preventing ‘access to information’,"" said Dhruv Garg, partner at Delhi-based think-tank India Governance and Policy (IGAP) Project.

While such technologies and systems demonstrably enhance user safety, they may not precisely align with the limited exemptions under Rule 11 of the DPDP Act, he said. “The Act’s prohibition on processing that may have a ‘detrimental effect on the well-being of a child’, under Section 9(2), lacks clarity.""

Concerns regarding child safety filters emerged as the focal point in submissions made by various stakeholders to Meity, which will now take all feedback into consideration before the rules are notified, and India’s first data privacy law is brought into effect.

Also read | Data privacy rules in limbo, tech industry on edge

A senior partner at a top law firm, which advises both Google and Meta, said that concerns around breaking child safety filters “is by far the biggest point of contention that has so far been raised in the DPDP rules’ consultation process"".

“The blanket ban on behavioural monitoring is a problem because it is also a positive obligation for technology platforms, which employ child safety tools online. The issue here is that this is an aspect of the principal legislation itself, which cannot be amended right now. This makes the blanket ban on behavioural monitoring a problem point—instead, a risk or harm-based approach to regulation could have been one way forward,"" the partner said, requesting anonymity.

According to Garg, in the absence of guidance or illustration on what amounts to a detrimental effect, tech firms may struggle to anticipate intangible “detriments, such as behavioural or psychological impacts, of their data processing in relation to children"".

In an earlier iteration of the draft law, a related concept of ‘harm’ in relation to users was defined under Clause 2(10)—to include bodily harm, identity theft, harassment, and significant loss, Garg said.

“The rules may allow for purpose-based exemption for tracking and behavioural monitoring that serve beneficial functions in the interest of online safety without creating risks of harm,"" he said. “Such an exemption should enable data processing which mitigates a ‘detrimental effect’ on a child. Further, a clear and specific definition or illustration may be incorporated within the rules for ‘detrimental effect’ in relation to children to reliably guide personal data processing.""

Google faces EU charges of breaching DMA rules: report,2025-02-21T17:04:35Z,"Alphabet unit Google is set to be charged with breaching EU rules aimed at checking the power of Big Tech after proposed changes to its search results failed to address the EU antitrust regulator’s concerns and those of its rivals, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said.

The move by the European Commission comes amid tensions with President Trump who has sided with US tech giants lobbying against EU regulations and criticizing fines as a form of tariff. That has in turn triggered concerns that the EU watchdog may ease up on Big Tech.

The European Commission has been investigating Google for potential breaches of the Digital Markets Act since March last year.

One probe focuses on whether Google favors its vertical search engines such as Google Shopping, Google Flights and Google Hotels over rivals, and whether it discriminates against third-party services on Google search results.

The imminent charges concerned this issue, the people said.

The EU competition watchdog declined to comment. Google referred to a December blog post by its director, EMEA competition, Oliver Bethell, who said the company is working to find a balanced solution with the Commission.

Bethell said more changes in Google’s search result format to appease rivals could result in the removal of certain helpful features.

The tech giant has in recent months announced a series of changes to search result formats in a bid to address conflicting demands from price-comparison sites, hotels, airlines and small retailers. The majority of them have dismissed the proposals as not DMA-compliant.

EU antitrust regulators are also not happy with Google’s threat to bring back blue links in search results if it cannot resolve rivals’ demands, one of the sources said.

The DMA prohibits Google from favoring its own products and services on its platforms or face fines of as much as 10% of its global annual revenue.

The DMA charges are likely to be sent to Google following decisions in the coming months into separate investigations into Apple and Meta Platforms, which are more advanced, one of the sources said.

The other DMA investigation takes aim at potential limitations that hinder app developers from informing users about offers outside the Google App Store free of charge.",https://nypost.com/2025/02/21/business/google-faces-eu-charges-of-breaching-dma-rules-report/
Google Pixel-maker Dixon to double revenue as India ramps up electronics production,2025-02-20T04:49:00Z,"By Praveen Paramasivam

(Reuters) - Dixon Technologies India, which assembles Google's Pixel smartphones, is set to more than double its revenue this fiscal year, driven by rapid growth in local electronics manufacturing, a top executive told Reuters.

Electronics manufacturing has gained momentum in India as global giants, including Alphabet's Google and Apple, expand their supply chain away from China.

""(For) the sector and Dixon, the growth path is going to be extremely aggressive in the coming future,"" Managing Director Atul Lall said on Wednesday.

The contract manufacturer reported a revenue of 177.13 billion rupees ($2.04 billion) for the 2024 financial year that ended in March, up 45% from a year earlier. Its revenue stood at 285.77 billion rupees for the nine months ended December 31.

Noida-based Dixon, which also assembles smartphones for firms such as China's Xiaomi and Oppo, has branched out into component manufacturing as India plans to offer billions of dollars in incentives to make parts for mobiles and laptops.

India's electronics manufacturing sector is set to grow to 6 trillion rupees in fiscal year 2027, from 1.46 trillion rupees in 2022, brokerage Motilal Oswal said in a note in December.

However, U.S. President Donald Trump's threat to impose reciprocal tariffs from early April could pose a risk, with analysts estimating potential losses at about $7 billion a year for India's export sectors.

Lall said Dixon, which has invested heavily to cater to rising export demand for electronics, is awaiting more details on the issue as the U.S. has made only broader statements so far.

Is Rigetti Computing’s (RGTI) Upside Potential Worth the Wild Ride?,2025-02-18T21:39:17Z,"Quantum computing stocks, including Rigetti Computing (RGTI), saw a notable surge after Alphabet (GOOG) announced a breakthrough with its Willow quantum chip. However, subsequent speculation by tech leaders that the technology is a decade away from practical use has led to volatility and a prudent “wait-and-see” attitude among investors. Despite being in its early development stage with minimal current revenue, the market is anticipating over 40% revenue growth by 2025, thanks largely to the scheduled launch of its 36-qubit and 108-qubit systems. Still, the company must address factors like scalability risks and stiff competition from industry leaders like IBM (IBM) and Google. In recent news, Rigetti debuted its 84-qubit Ankaa-3 system and has confirmed collaborations to enhance qubit efficiency. However, investors should tread carefully, as the company’s stock could continue to see sharp fluctuations based on changing market perceptions and technological progress. The stock is a high-risk, high-potential-reward lotto ticket for long-term investors willing to take a wild ride.

On the Road to Scalable Quantum Computing

Rigetti is a quantum computing company aiming to build the world’s most powerful computers. It created the first multiple-chip quantum process and started selling quantum computers in 2023. The company is vertically integrated, owning its manufacturing facility, which serves as a competitive advantage despite higher capital costs.

The company’s roadmap for 2025 includes the introduction of a new modular system architecture and a 36-qubit system release by mid-year. By the end of the year, they aim to launch a system with over 100 qubits. This follows significant improvements to the technology stack, including an all-new cryogenic hardware design, an optimized qubit chip, and implementation of the Alternating-Bias Assisted Annealing technique, which results in higher fidelity.

Regetti has recently unveiled its new flagship quantum computer, the 84-qubit Ankaa-3 system. The company’s latest hardware redesign aims to provide superior performance with two-qubit gate fidelity milestones of median 99.0% iSWAP gate fidelity and 99.5% median fidelity fSim gates. The Ankaa-3 system can be accessed via the Rigetti Quantum Cloud Services platform and will be available on Amazon Braket and Microsoft (MSFT) Azure in the first quarter of 2025.

In joint research with QphoX B.V., a Dutch quantum technology startup, and Qblox, a quantum control stack developer, Rigetti has shown that superconducting qubits could be read with an optical transducer. This significant achievement was published in Nature Physics and could have far-reaching implications for quantum computing. The microwave-to-optical transduction technology developed by QphoX could potentially replace cryogenic components with optical fibers, solving some challenges linked to using large numbers of qubits and leading to a potentially more scalable path for developing and launching quantum computing.

Cash Burn, but Confidence in Delivering on Its Roadmap

In the third quarter of 2024, the company recorded total revenue of $2.4 million. However, these gains were offset by the significant total operating expenses, which stood at $18.6 million for the same period. This resulted in an operating loss of $17.3 million and a net loss for the quarter of $14.8 million.

The CEO has given recent guidance that with around $225 million in cash and no debt, the company is confident in delivering its 2025 roadmap.

Analysts Are Bullish

The stock has been on a rocket ride since late last year, climbing over 731% in the past three months. But the ride hasn’t been smooth, with the stock roughly three times as volatile as the general market. It trades at a heady P/S ratio of 161.97x. Such a rich valuation carries the risk of considerable, often rapid, adjustment if perceptions shift or if there’s any shortfall in the company’s growth or technological advancements.

Analysts following the company have been bullish on the stock. For example, B. Riley’s Craig Ellis recently reiterated a Buy rating on the shares and raised the price target to $15 (from $8.50), noting quantum computing is “what’s next” after artificial intelligence uptake, and company developments could elevate demand for the stock.

Rigetti Computing is rated a Strong Buy overall, based on the recent recommendations of four analysts. The average price target for RGTI stock is $15.67, which represents a potential upside of 43.89% from current levels.

See RGTI analyst ratings.

RGTI in Review

Despite recent turbulence in the quantum computing sector, Rigetti Computing stands out with its ambitious plans and significant technological advancements. Future growth is anticipated, with the company’s commitment to enhancing the power of its quantum systems, as demonstrated by the recent launch of the 84-qubit Ankaa-3 system and collaborations aimed at improving qubit efficiency. However, Rigetti faces challenges like scalability concerns and competition with tech giants like IBM and Google. Still, the company maintains a confident outlook on delivering its 2025 roadmap, and analysts are optimistic about Rigetti’s future. While it may be a wild roller coaster ride, it might be one worth taking for long-term investors.

Missed Out on Alphabet Stock? My Favourite AI Stock to Buy and Hold,2025-02-11T15:00:00Z,"There are some stocks out there that are popular, and some offer major deals on the market today.

So, you missed out on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock and are wondering if you’ll ever get a second chance to invest in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. The good news is that while Alphabet stock has been a dominant player, it’s not the only company making significant strides in AI.

In fact, there’s one Canadian company quietly building a strong foundation in AI and enterprise data management. That’s OpenText (TSX:OTEX). If you’re looking for an AI-driven stock to buy and hold for the long term, OpenText may be your best bet.

Why OpenText?

Headquartered in Waterloo, Ont., OpenText is Canada’s leading enterprise information management company. While it may not have Google’s household name recognition, it does help Google manage its data. In today’s digital world, where AI is transforming industries, OpenText is positioned at the forefront, helping companies leverage AI-powered tools for automation, security, and business intelligence.

OpenText isn’t just integrating AI into its products. It’s actively shaping the future of enterprise AI. A major part of its growth strategy is OpenText Aviator, a suite of AI-powered tools designed to enhance business operations. The Aviator suite includes an AI-powered conversational search for enhanced customer service and enterprise knowledge retrieval. It has predictive analytics to help companies forecast trends and automate decision-making. Plus, it has generative AI solutions that assist in content creation and knowledge management

These AI-powered solutions are designed to streamline workflows, improve cybersecurity, and help companies gain valuable insights from their data. Unlike Google, which focuses on consumer AI and search algorithms, OpenText is focused on enterprise applications. Helping businesses manage information in a way that improves efficiency and reduces risk.

More to come

One of OpenText’s strongest growth strategies has been through acquisitions. In early 2023, OpenText completed a $5.8 billion acquisition of Micro Focus, a U.K.-based software company that specializes in IT automation and data analytics. This acquisition has significantly expanded OpenText’s AI and cybersecurity offerings.

One of the key reasons investors should consider OpenText as a long-term AI stock is its financial stability and steady growth trajectory. Unlike high-risk AI startups that are burning cash, OpenText is a well-established, profitable company.

The company has a market capitalization of $11.57 billion and a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.16 at writing, making it a relatively affordable investment compared to high-flying AI stocks like Google. OpenText also has a strong cash flow, with levered free cash flow of $928 million. Therefore, it generates significant profits even after capital expenditures.

Additionally, OpenText is a dividend-paying stock with a forward annual dividend yield of 3.49%. This makes it an attractive choice for long-term investors who want exposure to AI while also benefiting from stable income.

Stand out choice

Google may dominate AI in the consumer space, but OpenText is carving out a niche in the enterprise AI sector. Here’s why OpenText might be the better pick for long-term investors. While Google focuses on AI for search, advertising, and cloud services, OpenText specializes in AI-driven solutions for businesses, helping companies manage and secure their data.

Plus, OpenText is a leader in enterprise data security, an area where AI is becoming increasingly important. With growing concerns over cyber threats, OpenText’s AI-powered security solutions make it a compelling investment. OpenText’s stock is trading at a lower valuation than many of the big AI names, providing an opportunity for investors to get in at a reasonable price. And unlike Google, OpenText pays a dividend, making it a more attractive option for income-focused investors.

Future outlook

Looking ahead, OpenText is focused on expanding its AI-driven cloud services and continuing to integrate its recent acquisitions. The AI stock’s management has set aggressive targets for the next few years, with plans to grow its cloud business, enhance AI capabilities, and strengthen its cybersecurity offerings.

With AI adoption expected to accelerate across industries, OpenText is well-positioned to capitalize on the enterprise shift towards AI-powered solutions. As more businesses look for ways to automate processes, improve security, and manage data efficiently, OpenText’s services will become increasingly valuable.",https://www.fool.ca/2025/02/11/missed-out-on-alphabet-stock-my-favourite-ai-stock-to-buy-and-hold/
